2,google,2014,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.), overnight ski trips to Vermont, overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer, summer picnics at Chelsea piers, and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding, but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance. * It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows, as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture. Keep the focus on the user. Everything else will follow.",0.688755,-7.485783,-0.02208716255772408,0.07346135239461057,5.0,0.12444619886286552,0.489956487956488

It causes a lot more work for the rest of the team, because these managers are unable to make quality contributions. On the opposite side, I've seen a lot of people brought in at levels much lower than they should be. This can be frustrating because the promotion process is not simple.

When I need assistance from another engineer or another team, I typically get quick and effective help. Office politics exist, but compared to anywhere else I've worked they're not a problem.  - Compensation / perks: I'm very satisfied with my compensation. The assorted perks are pretty valuable as well -- the food and fitness facilities are my favorites.  - Work/life balance: From reading other reviews here it seems that experiences in this area vary. But mine have been excellent. I rarely work over 40 hours a week, and when I do it's because I personally feel engaged by what I'm working on, never because of pressure from my manager or team lead. I almost never check work emails during evenings or weekends, and when I come in to the office in the morning I don't find that they've been emailing me during that period. I actually have gotten gentle pushback from my team lead when I asked if he could log in from home later in the evening to review/approve a change I wanted to submit. - Impostor syndrome: The flip side of working with so many smart and effective people is that it can be difficult to recognize your own value, if you're used to being the smartest guy in the room and suddenly you're surrounded by people who are at or above your ability, that can be a bit of a blow to the ego. I eventually worked through this, but it took the better part of a year.  - Slow ramp-up: One of the drivers of impostor syndrome for me was that it took me a lot longer to find my footing and get effective here than at other jobs. Some of that is on me for not asking more questions, but I think more proactive support from leadership might have helped. The environment at Google is very unique and there's a lot to learn before an engineer can get things done.  - Living in a bubble: The perks and so on make life at Google very comfortable.

Transfer packages are terrible, HR always finds ways to negate merit increases when transferring by lowering salary, relocation packages are bare minimum (but most people here come from money, so that's ok I guess). Slowly turning into a conventional company, bloated middle-management doesn't ruffle feathers, protects selves vs. team/good of the company. Benefits are decreasing as company grows and becomes more conventional. Don't pay lip service to career development. You're working with some of the best and brightest in the world, don't let them rot on the vine due to corporate politics. Stick with products by marketing them for more than two quarters.

Honestly, only work here if you live here. Do not travel to work at Google. It doesn't work out, and everyone ends up leaving to find a mate, more money, Do not move away from family to be here.

Because Google is involved in a large number of industries, there are plenty of opportunities abound to find something that you're interested in. We are highly encouraged to move around the company.  The company really takes care of us professionally and personally. The benefits are incredibly high. My team has been on offsites to Tahoe, Vegas, and Hawaii in the last year. The company creates an environment where you don't really want to leave campus.  Lastly, being on the inside and seeing all of the technology before it launches is really like seeing the future. Some of the unannounced products that we're working on is science fiction. There are many projects that get rejected or shutdown because they aren't Google-scale. Any of these projects that gets rejected would be really successful if it was created by a startup. This also means that the bar for launch is much higher.  Google is no longer a startup. It is hard to move fast. We try to balance creating innovative products and a consistent user experience that makes it hard to move quickly as you end up spending a lot of time trying to integrate into existing products.  You are working with incredibly intelligent and incredibly ambitious people. This makes the environment a bit competitive and people focused on what gets them ahead.

This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations. If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives. If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it. At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own. On another occasion, one of my personal projects was ""taken over"" by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative. I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager's team. That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful.

Management is generally appalling, I literally have never encountered people with less ability to lead and motivate people and just understand the basic dynamics of people. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Even though they are participating highly both in terms of operations and projects. Managers make false underhanded promises about being kept on to many contractors in the hope that this will motivate people to work even harder. But people talk and such strategies become transparent. It is embarrassing spending so much money on parties/off-sites etc. while the contractors slave away and then are told there is no budget to keep them on. (Many of them are far more intelligent than the FTEs and working much harder, and it feels like they know that and are just using them for as much as they can) Googlers have a tendency to become entitled and egotistical. Yes, the physical workplace is great, but it is too much of a bubble and actually the environment is stressful and not really all that friendly. Even the Kitchen staff seem miserable. The expectation of excellence is fraught in the air, which often results in an underhanded competitiveness between team members and long, long working hours. Ya those pool tables are nice, but I never really had time to play them. Googlers are too mono, there is no diversity in thought, age, race etc. Which is a huge criticism really when you think of the values they hide behind and the people they should be considering. If you strip away the benefits and the incredible value of having Google on your CV, this would have been one of the worst employment experiences in my life. I think the difficulty is getting to grips with the frustration of how they are perceived, and how they actually operate. Many of the FTEs have worked nowhere but Google and think they are uber fantastic for having landed a job there and what they are doing is the most important thing in the world but there lack of life experience shows massively in how they handle their work and many of them feel like they are part of a cult. Get over yourself and drop that ego. There are doctors, teachers, nurses...all sorts of people in the real world doing amazing things. We are just serving those people so take a slice of that humble pie. Step back, stress is not productive, trust your team to get things done. Learn about people, care about people...at the very least the people on your team who are working incredibly hard. If you told some managers that your whole family was just killed in car crash, I don't think they would even have a fundamental human capacity of acknowledging that.

One drawback is there are no inventory level guarantees. This is true of any network, but with Google it can get even more difficult as you can't reserve inventory (expensive home page buyouts aside). A bidder can bump you out of certain placements by bidding higher and raising his maximum CPM.

10668,amazon,2014,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.  I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.  Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.  Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.  On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.  Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.  Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.  As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.  Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!  Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.  Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking! Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.  I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.  Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.  Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.  SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.  Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long. The thing about thinking long-term is getting more and more worrying as the company has not turned a tidy profit and is trying to conquer the world with its lofty expansion strategies. I don't know what kind of secret recipe management is cooking but seeing the company not making much money never feels comfortable.",1.3866448,-6.124179,0.0017846907558833928,0.05778993921140282,4.0,0.08274500768049148,0.5320151049667179
22619,amazon,2014,"monetary compensation (base salary, stock options, quarterly bonuses, sign on and retention bonuses) benefits (fairly generous time off, cheap health plans) company reputation 10% employee discount ability to transfer after 12 months in a position Where to begin... Everything you'll read in the previous reviews about the Area Manager job and Amazon are true. You'll think that with years of supervisory/management experience that you can handle the job. The base salary, bonuses, and stock options look so good on paper that you feel like an idiot if you don't take it. But the fact is, as previous reviews state, they are a trap (relocation and sign on have to repaid even if you're fired), the stock options are drawn out over four years. The majority of AM hires won't see four years, so think about that. The 401k match is the same. So much of that fancy number on the offer letter is tied to a length of time in the company you probably won't make.  You are micromanaged into a fine dust everyday by your Ops Manager who is more than likely funneling down the same treatment that they're receiving from the Sr. Ops Manager. You will be called every 10 minutes to be asked about something you gave an update on the previous call 10 minutes earlier. The only way to get a temporary break from it is to take your lunches and breaks outside of the building. You will be called all the time, bathroom and all, to be asked 'what's going on in (insert department)'?  Despite having 'manager' in your title you are a front-line grunt, that is it. Your years of industry or military experience don't mean squat. You WILL be explained the simplest concepts in-depth by Ops and Sr. Ops. You have no say-so in how the actual operation is run, EVERYTHING is run by an Ops Manager. You will run every single operational decision you want to make by the Ops Manager first. It may or may not be listened to. You will be asked to explain why your department failed to make plan or rate despite you having had ZERO say in staffing, labor allocation, planning, work flow, etc.  Know that the hourly associates are treated with absolutely zero respect. They do not matter to senior management, at all. There is no attempt to make them feel as if Amazon is a place to make a career. They are required to do more and more every day. And if they don't or can't then they'll just bring in the next bunch of temps to take their place. Their performance is reviewed by the entire senior management team every week in what's called SPPR. Literally one bad day can put an associate on a written warning, one! Management attempts to appease them with things like a board to bring up complaints, ice cream every few months, or an annual picnic that less than a third will attend. And don't ever make the mistake of trying be an advocate for the hourly associates.  When you apply you may be subject to a bait and switch. A position in a popular city may be posted, you'll apply to that position, only for the actual location to be another city when you're offered. They have to do this for the smaller (very small) cities like Campbellsville, KY, Fernley, NV, and Coffeyville, KS. They'll sell you on the ability to transfer after 12 months. What they don't tell you is that it's completely up to the senior management at your site to sign off on it. And if senior management has some site specific rule, such as minimum time in the building, or they aren't full of AM's, your transfer will be politely declined with a smile. And there is nothing you can do about that.  The management team is a rotating door. Your associates (the ones that do actually care to talk to you) will tell you that you're at least the 25th manager they've had, depending on long how they've worked there. Yeah, I'll say that again, at least the 25th. Most Amazon sites have been open only since 2006. Let that sink in.  Don't bother getting too close to the other AM's. The quickest way to move up to Ops is by throwing other AM's under the bus. You'll recognize these AM's because they will send by out bi-weekly emails to the entire management team calling out any mistakes that you've made and what they've done or are doing to fix it. They look for a weak link. And the only way to get it to stop is to do it back to that person. It creates unnecessary competition and distrust.  3 days off sounds good...if it happens. Your shift will probably be called for mandatory OT at minimum once per month, and it will be at the last minute, and it MAY happen on a day that's not your scheduled OT day. Associates have to stay under 50 hours per week, even if they're called in for mandatory OT. That means you'll spend so much time being short because you have to send people home early.  And lastly...you will be required to do physical labor. And not just throwing a couple boxes here and there or picking in the aisles a bit to help. You will do the job that your associates do...a lot! It doesn't sound so bad until you realize that you've spent a huge chunk of your day having to do it... in addition to the countless flavor of the day projects assigned to you or all of the admin duties. Every day. Again, there's nothing wrong with a little manual labor, but a highly compensated and experienced people manager shouldn't have to spend several HOURS of their day doing what hourly associates are being paid $12/hour to do. It's a waste of their skills and talents. No need to give advice. Amazon knows how they treat Area Managers, and they're ok with that.

It is a great place to learn and grow your skills in an environment full of well-qualified leaders. If you get a good team and good manager you will likely love Amazon. But in management you are stretched quite thin, so if you are at the point in your career where you need or expect coaching it will not happen. Amazon is a survival of the fittest type of atmosphere. Each year the bar is raised to weed out the weak. At first this was a challenge I loved. But then as you aspire to move up levels in the company it becomes a barrier, because you can change titles and clearly shoulder more and more responsibility, more and more projects yet they can state the bar for a promotion is out of reach so it becomes discouraging after all your effort. It is an atmosphere of leaders so in order to stand out you take on more projects to get noticed for promotions. Promotions in general are few and hard to come by unnecessarily which discourages you from staying at the company past a certain timeframe.

Very high turn-over. Very oppressive work environment. Non ergonomic work stations, and they don't care about preventing injury. You cant even get a pull out keyboard tray for your desk, unless you work in Seattle. Unfair policies. The survey that goes out at the end of the call...it used to be that they rated you by the volume of calls that you took and the amount of nos, that was reasonable. They changed that a few years ago to No vs Yes, and that is all they look at. So for instance if only 20% of the people you talked to respond to the survey(which is typical depending on department its usually 10-30%) the other 80% of people you talked to don't count, and that is all they base your performance on. In addition you have to get 7 yeses to offset every no to meet their goals. If a call is transferred to you and drops and you never talk to the person you still have to send the survey.if you have an escalated call transferred a supervisor the associate sends the survey not the supervisor that takes the call.They also count policy nos against the associate. If the associate upholds their policy, and someone doesn't like the policy it is counted against the associate. Amazon has become so big that a lot of internal processes don't work effectively, and no one wants to fix core issues. The motto within is ""disagree and commit"" .

When everyone gets the same raise in the same amount at the same intervals there is no incentive, and what results is an imbalance of work load and a work environment of people that don't care. High turnover results in money loss due to mistakes made by unseasoned workers, not gain by a lower wage without benefits for new hires.

Another Con I've noticed is the managers not truly taking the time to get to know their associates even if they may change roles eventually.

22910,amazon,2014,"The company offers fairly competitive compensation packages, lots of perks, a great environment in which you can learn and grow. Amazon's one of the few companies where a determined employee can really put in the effort, rise up and make a difference IF you're willing to go the distance.  Amazon's pretty lenient on sick days or unexpected events, and works with you. Never had an issue calling out or needing to leave early (for the most part). You can learn a lot, move within the company and they have fairly good benefits package (don't expect an employee discount though, it's pretty much non-existent). Amazon has incredibly poor work-life balance. You're expected to work stupid amounts of mandatory overtime (yes, mandatory). Complain, you're told ""You signed a legal agreement stating you'd be available."" to remind you that, legally, you said you would when you were hired 40 hour work week can easily stretch 60+ hours. Being told that comes off oddly threatening.  Internal documentation is next to non-existent. You can find half a dozen different ways to do the same thing on the internal wiki and all of them contradict each other or are woefully out of date. Ask management for clarification, they tell you to look at the internal documents (see above) or to ""do the needful"" in order to make it work. You never really quite know if you're violating a policy on something because everything you're told is nebulous. When you bring up the documentation is vague or contradicts itself you're told ""we grew too fast"". Oh. The rest of it is ""tribal knowledge"". Hope you've got a coworker that knows what's going on.  Employee reviews are stack-ranked. A certain percentage of employees MUST be put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) even if they have NO issues with this performance. This is severely degrading to employees, and outright kills morale (both for people put on a PIP and those who they're friends with). Having a mandatory policy that X% of employees must be punished come review time kills Amazon's talent pool people. It causes unnecessary disruption, and can affect employees who've had to endure rough periods in their life and come back from them only to find out they're now punished with a PIP and are told their employment status with Amazon is now at risk.  Amazon preaches ""frugality"" but doesn't follow it. You can literally destroy thousands of dollars of good equipment in order to do your job and nobody bats an eye (it's the ""cost of doing business""), but you need to expense something and out come the magnifying glasses. Documentation. Consistency. Don't just tell employees ""You HAVE to do this because you signed a legal agreement."" when it comes to overtime. Work with them. Talk to them. We get sometimes we have to rise above as it's part of the job, but when a company with as much Amazon tell us it doesn't have funding, that we're short-staffed but forces us into overtime it kills the vibe and burns employees out.

22965,amazon,2014,"Amazon will make stronger, tougher and more calloused in your professional life. If you can make it at Amazon, you can make it most other places. Amazon is an awful place to work if you are not a good cultural fit. By cultural fit, you must be willing to back stab, be dishonest, work extraordinary hours and give up much of your personal life to this tribute to Jeff's sizable ego. Amazon used to be a great, cutting edge retail giant. Now, with one misstep after the next, the retail juggernaut is stumbling. Amazon is an incredibly siloed and disorganized company. It's not uncommon for three or for teams to be working on the same project and not know about the other teams until your work gets scrapped or even worse, you're told three quarters of the way that you need to now collaborate with other people. This is very common and a large reason amazon can't launch quality devices. Governance is unheard of at Amazon, and is a major contributor to the ""slap on some duct tape and move on"" mentality of the company. Amazon's internal systems are a joke...they are homegrown and piss-poor in quality. I was stunned when I started with amazon 4 years ago how behind the times Amazon is internally,  In the same vein, amazon's annual review process is practically archaic and a bit heavy-handed. They force every manager to stack rank their people and force them in to a bell curve. People are ranked equally on individual work and feedback from peers. This leads to people torpedoing each other through anonymous feedback in an effort to stay on top. If you happen to fall in to the bottom of the bell curve, you are managed out of the company. I have been forced to do this, because we have to hit a distribution across the bell curve. I fought it, because it was the right thing to do. Compensation is then determined by how a person ranks against everyone else. This is the same annual review process that Microsoft made national news last year for abandoning because it was archaic, reduced overall moral, and made talent development and retention difficult. No one wants to work with the sword of Damocles constantly hanging over them.  Compensation is another reason amazon is a joke. Much of your comp is tied up in restricted stock units RSU's that vest over several years. I was awarded 100 shares last review cycle 2014. I am not able to realize this for two years, because it doesn't start vesting until 2016. My RSU award was based on stock prices at the time ($360), but since stock tanked with yet another quarter of abysmal financials my award is worth much less. In fact, with this latest nosedive, I lost 17k this year in comp. Jeff loves to talk about how he doesn't pay attention to stock prices, he is focused on the long-term vision. That song and dance routine only works for so long with investors and employees. I care about stock prices, 1/3 of my comp is tied to the mercurial rise and fall of amazon stock.  Overall, amazon is a supremely disjointed, disorganized corporate version of the hunger games. Please,think about this before you sign on...what is your integrity worth to you? Treat people better, employ some kind of strategic governance across the company, and stop hiring new MBA's with no real-world experience. There is a reason that the non-seasonal avg tenure at Amazon is less than two years...",-12.042549,-4.4616504,-0.06852215777399076,0.06422803995655113,1.0,0.029175219941348973,0.40998114788437356

22976,amazon,2014,"There are worse things you can do with a B.A. and knowlege of a foreign language. If you're analytical and you like researching and solving problems, this might work out well for you.  Some teams of investigators are doing interesting and engaging work. But be aware that other teams are slogging through task after boring task. You want to find out before you start what the work will really entail and particularly how many tasks you will be required to do per hour. In general, the higher the number of investigations per hour, the more routine the work is.  Colleagues are generally smart and friendly.  Overtime is usually available if you want it.  Start times are flexible, so you can come in earlier if you're an early riser or later if you're a late riser.  If you don't like how things are going, just wait 5 minutes and it will change. The change may or may not be an improvement, but it will be different. Pay is on the low end. For comparison, including OT pay, it's about one half to two fifths of a sofware developer salary (not counting software developer bonuses and stock options.)  Overtime is mandatory for 2 months out of the year, roughly mid-November to mid-January. You can't take any vacation during the holidays and may be required to work ON the actual holidays.  You're required to work on weekends (Sun-Thurs or Tues-Sat).  You are required to account for all your time in 5-minute increments, which is exhausting and dehumanizing.  It's easy to feel like an interchangeable cog in a machine when everything you do is monitored, measured and assigned a numerical value.  It's not always obvious that the people steering the ship know what they're doing. The investigators are smart and have a lot of collective knowledge, but it's hard for them to make their voices heard. Holidays should be sacred. We get very few of them.

If you want to have an interesting job where you can grow and do not mind to work hard you may be willing to accept that Amazon is not perfect.

Not that it's trivial to get to Amazon, but it's for sure easier.  The unique knowledge and experience that you will get in Amazon is priceless and worth all the disadvantages described below. You will not learn distributed systems just from books and Amazon is a perfect place to do it. And there is a chance that you will fall in love with the company and stay there for long. If not, what you learn will significantly increase your chances to get a much better job. There is a lot of stress and pressure, so many people around you will be overwhelmed. For the same reason personnel rotation is very high, so knowledge is constantly being lost and you are expected to live with that.  The recruiter who contacts you at the beginning determines which team you will be in for the first year, you have very little to say about that. So ask about it at the beginning and try to find a different recruiter if you do not like what the team does.  There are basically no perks, free food, raises or bonuses in Amazon as it operates on low margins and invests all profits. That make it very frugal. Assume that the salary & stocks which you get at the beginning is what you will receive for few years.

23040,amazon,2014,"Despite my low star-rating there were a few perks available when working for the fulfillment center. There is a machine that dispenses terrible but free coffee in some of the break rooms. There is a half-hearted attempt to provide some climate control in the heat of the summer months. The price of health benefits are somewhat reasonable for a single person such as myself. Quite a few vacation days are offered which is wonderful because you'll need every one of them! Oh my, where should I begin. I guess the very beginning would suffice. I'll try to be as eloquent as possible but I'm not a poet or an essayist (and I don't own any ruffled shirts or tweed jackets)! I should have sensed trouble when I attended the mass hiring event. The facility had not yet opened to it's doors so the location was a hotel in Southern Central New Jersey. I was anticipating an interview as I sometimes enjoy the opportunity to speak with new and interesting people. However, they offered the positions to everyone who arrived contingent upon a successful drug screen and background check. Many potential employees arrived at the event in casual dress and one was actually wearing shorts and flip-flops. I kid you not!      The presentations then and during the first-day orientation were too good to be true. A utopian worker's paradise was promised by the hiring team and the management staff. I was reeled in by the promise that if I worked hard and followed directions I could create a life for myself in the Fulfillment center.      I was employed as a warehouse picker and it was a boring, mind-numbing and thankless task. Some of the members of the management staff were extremely rude, condescending or otherwise lacking in people and communication skills. Berating intelligent and skilled employees is not a proven method of promoting performance. Usually it results in high employee turnover which this facility experienced in the few months I was there. To be fair I believe the managers had shifts that were much longer than the standard ten and a half hours. I believe some of them worked between twelve and sixteen hours a day. Breaks were too short as it took quite a while to travel to the various rest areas. Essentially you had 15 minutes to log out and log back in to your work station. This does not constitute a 15 minute break.     Equipment and systemic computer break downs were common problems as well. The bugs should have been fixed before the facility was opened for business. Treat the employees more like human beings and less like mechanical devices. Fatigue and injuries were extremely common especially among the older and less athletic associates. Longer rest periods would have helped as well.",-8.005777,-11.351904,-0.05994310602912821,0.06067503130018177,1.0,0.08309295967190702,0.4579832156147945

The insurance plans are top notch with a lot of choices, and cover most services. The annual rating structure breeds a culture of doing something to just get ahead. All of the teamwork and collaboration goes out the window when the focus is shifted towards who is the top and who is the bottom.  The principles are not well explained or followed through outside of the corporate office which creates a confusing environment where those who do go between the spaces don't know what to expect.

It seems lots of the Tier I employees are good workers with good attitudes, definitely made tons of friends here at work. You get the occasional slacker but they tend to not last.  Your health benefits are low cost and provide great coverage. Work-life balance is one of this companies downfall, they expect you to drop whatever plans you have in order to work the overtime they call on very short notice. This overtime usually falls in line with holidays (New Years, Easter, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) so it's hard to spend time with your family during those holidays. Also don't expect to get Black Friday off unless you're willing to use Paid Time Off or Unpaid Time Off.  Lack of experience in management is another of it's downfalls. They tend to hire managers right out of college, which means these managers lack the experience needed to work with or even discipline workers. Several times I've seen them pawn these assignments off to the Tier 3s because the managers didn't want to get the bad rep. They also don't have the courage to say ""no"" when a request comes down from their management, even if it means it'll strongly impact the stress and workload on the tier 1s below them.  Management's focus on numbers and backing other management no matter what is it's final downfall. Above your AM (Area Manager) they tend to focus less on personnel and more on the numbers. This creates a problem if an issue comes up that needs to be go up the chain of command. This includes employees not being trained when they should be simply because management doesn't want to spend the hours to train. This increases the stress and likelihood of mistakes happening because it's always the same people doing the same stressful job day in and day out and on every occasion. Consider spending the time and money needed to make sure that the stressful jobs are able to be evenly distributed across a greater number of employees.

There's no communication between the manager and the associate unless it's during stand up at the start of the shift or after lunch.

23134,amazon,2014,"Smart Coworkers At Amazon you’re going to work with some really bright individuals. Everyone I work with is very intelligent and very hard working. That’s evident by the clock ticking down to 6:00 and seeing all your coworkers typing still at their door desks.  Interesting Work The work you do at Amazon is already quite fun. On the retail side it’s like running your own business. There’s so much to do and you’re never bored with the work. It’s neat to see how everything you do impacts your business and improves it.  Casual Work Environment It's also quite nice that you can go to work in jeans and a t-shirt. Bringing your dog to work is great also, but really it's just a wait to keep you there longer. Before I go into the cons I’m going to say that this is based upon my personal experience during my 3 positions on the retail side of the company.  No Work Life Balance 60 hour work weeks are normal. Meetings at 5:00 happen and people regularly work past 7:00. It feels like I go to work, get home, work some more, go to sleep, and repeat. On the weekends I get a bit of a break, but I still am required to work as I have certain reports and other tasks that have not yet been automated to complete. Amazon work kills all hope I have of an outside life.  Always on call Even being on vacation doesn’t matter as you’ll receive high priority emails management wants answered right away. Holidays are no exceptions. I was called once at 6:00 AM on a holiday because of a promotion running at a competitor I had to match. I finished all tasks associated with the promotion at about 8:00 PM. I didn’t have a holiday as a result, but customers were able to get a good deal on the retail products I was in charge of.  Single People Preferred Do not expect to see your kids or significant other regularly. If you mention you have to leave early, like 5:00 (which is a normal 8 to 5 day) to pick up your kids or go to a dinner date, expect to be mocked by your boss after you’re gone. I’m regularly late now to almost all after work events because of work that is given and required to be completed after 5:00.  Too Much Work This is great as you’re never bored, but it also means you’ll constantly be working. Lunch normally doesn’t happen as you’re in a meeting during that time, completing something for later deadline, or rushing for a fire drill. It’s basically survival of the fittest here. You will need to automate your tasks or risk drowning in a pile of endless work. There are a lot of improvements needed to be made at Amazon and management wants them done now.  High Bars Once you’ve automated your work and reached your goals, you’ll be asked to surpass that the next year. Eventually your goals will become impossible to achieve. I’ve mentioned this to management and their answers are normally along the lines of “I’m not sure how you’ll be able to improve, but you need to.”  Small Raises I’ve been lucky that I’ve achieved high ratings on my reviews and so my raises have been just above inflation. Even so, they’re laughable. Raises occur only on your base pay and your base pay is relatively a small portion of your compensation.  Golden-handcuffs Amazon entices you with a bonus your first two years and stock every year afterwards. If you leave the company before the end of the year in which you received a bonus you’ll have to pay it back. If you leave during one of the years in which your stock vest it’s like you worked for nothing. My stock is almost equal to my base pay for example. This keeps you working for the company.  Low Base Pay Living off your base pay is also terrible as the cost of living here in Seattle is rising. You’re income on paper will look like you make a decent amount of money, but only because of your stock/bonuses. If you choose not to cash out of it when it vests you’ll be living by meager means as most of your pay will go to rent and other expenses. Having a low base pay also puts you in a different bracket for loans as they don’t consider your grants and bonuses reliable income.  Frugality Only the bus pass is free. Parking is not and parking is expensive. Amazon will reimburse up $160 worth of parking, but at over $25.00 a day it doesn’t go very far. If you can get monthly parking you’ll pay less, but there’s a long wait list. On the bright side most people leave after 2 years so you may get a spot if you stay long enough. There are also no employee perks that I’m aware of, except free coffee and tea in the kitchen.  Performance Improvement Plans PIP is very real at Amazon. A certain number of people in your department every year will be put on it. Essentially the weakest link will be eliminated. If you don’t perform better than someone else you’ll be let go. Politics are very real and active as well. Consider it similar to Game of Thrones. Make sure someone owes you a favor and preferably that’s someone at a higher level.  Promotions Lateral moves are common, promotions are not. Most people rotate after 1-1/2 years. Getting promoted requires laterally moving to a high job level. Once in that level you will need to perform the job better than coworkers doing the same job at the level you’re trying to get promoted to. This accounts to doing a much harder job with more work at a lower wage than everyone else until you’ve proven yourself. You’re also competing with other coworkers at your level and job for the promotion. This works great for the company, but makes you feel like you’re way underpaid for the job you’re doing.  Turnover I’m not sure the exact numbers as Amazon is constantly hiring new people, but it seems high. I’ve seen lots of people leave Amazon that I’ve worked with. The average stay seems to be about 2 years. After that people leave for better opportunities. Consider this place a stepping stone to the next job. Also expect your workload to increase each time someone leaves until they fill that position. You may be moving on before that happens though as Amazon has a really high bar for hiring. Amazon could be a great place to work. I actually enjoyed working for the company for the first 1-1/2 years. After that I realized things were not going to get better. My work days did not get shorter, only longer. I now feel like all I do is work and am starting to burn out as a result. I could probably deal with most of the other flaws, but I work to live not live to work. I’m counting down the days until my next stock grant and then I’m heading for the door.  I’m not the only one either that thinks like this. Most people will not speak the truth, even if you ask me to my face I’ll lie and say I’m not going anywhere. I’d lie because I know the politics of the place would stab me in the back if I told the truth. Working at Amazon is a job, not a career.  If the stock ever crashes you can also expect a mass exodus of workers as our base pay isn’t comparable to other offers out there.  My advice is to look at my list of cons and figure out a way to fix them. We do the same thing to improve the experience of the customer, why don’t we improve the work life of our employees?

Because it is Amazon, you will take the offer right away without thinking and plus the offer is so lucrative that you will just take it. Don’t be fooled with the stock options they offer as a part of the hiring package. Ask for more base salary or joining bonus. Average tenure at amazon for an employee is 1.5 years and stock options mature in 3rd and 4th year and hence you don’t see a single penny of it. Amazon pays you high but takes away your personal and family life. It is a place where everyone tries to prove they are right, even at the cost of other colleagues. So it is a rat race, where everyone tries to outsmart other at any cost. In the end people are very exhausted and look for other options. The office politics gets to you if you believe that hard work is the only means to progress in your career. Not many people know that amazon has this unique culture of laying off 10% of the work force every year irrespective of what you put in. So your relationship with your manager and other managers also will matter when it comes to review. Also, at amazon, anyone can write a review about you at any time, which will count towards your final performance review. So you have to watch your back constantly and have to be people smart and also work smart. This is not easy because even if you put in 120% you may not be in the best books with others because you did company’s good and in doing so, you stepped over someone in some way, who will write a review about you and to which you have no visibility to. So what you will see in your review will always be a surprise. If a decision is made to let you go per the 10% lay off rule, then they will give you 100 excuses and reasons of not performing. Except if you join in the last 3 months of the year, you are in for a review. I joined in September and in 15th week of my service, I was told that I am a part of the performance improvement program, which is a sophisticated name for the 10% people, who are walked off on any day the manager wants. The guard comes with a box and takes your tag and computer and you walk with an embarrassment. The culture is so rough that you hardly make any good friends at work because everyone is constantly thinking you are being nice but not sure if you will write a decent review. Coming to AWS supply chain group. This group is nothing but laid off/struggling workforce of Dell, who have pulled each other into AWS. The whole group is a big mess as people come and leave in few months. Here the work culture is even worst that the amazon retail groups. The team is small, the work is loads, the ups and downs in business are huge because of which planning almost always goes wrong and you never know how that bad planning affects your work and you are made a scape goat of the events that were beyond your control. Someone somewhere is constantly counting the strikes against you and you will see that in your review or some other way when you finally walk off from AWS. The whole company runs on excel sheets with no ERP system that is strong enough to give visibility to people. So there is constant guessing and errors in what you communicate. Even if this is happening, you should be able to prove that you are smart and good at all times. There is a culture of writing a white paper. Any time something goes wrong you write a 1 pager and publish to the group. The management believes in churning papers, which no one really reads in future but you need to write them for proving your point or to cover of the mess that happened for no fault of yours but may be held against you. These papers take your office time and then you have meetings that never end and the work will start after 5.00pm. They actually have hired someone to help you write these papers. Amazon does not believe in ppt but believes in word documents. They are so frugal that they do not have a color printer on every floor. You may have to go 10 floors up or down to get that 1 colored copy. The seating space is so cramped up and they call it high density seating. You can actually touch 3-4 people if you stretch ur hand on both sides. There is a wait list for 2 years for parking in the building. So you eventually take a bus every day. All I would say is it is a big mess in AWS supply chain group. Which company hires and fires people in a period of 1 year, just because someone wrote something against you. The trust and healthy work culture does not exist. You will lose your health and hair in return of wealth that you cannot enjoy. It is not easy to survive in this place if you are not work smart, diplomatic, very fast paced and consistently vigilant to watch your back. Everyone leaves with a bitter taste. It is very common that on a Monday morning, your very next seat colleague is not at his seat because he worked his last on Friday and nobody knew it till he did not show up. Eventually you will learn he was recycled. Above all, there is no severance package and amazon takes every penny of your joining bonus and relocation back even if they lay you off and you did not resign out of your own will. So do not spend that money you get on something you like, because you never know how long you will be at AWS before you are long forgotten because the show must go on and there are lot of qualified people in the world that this company can afford to recycle. I never had experienced and never believed that a company has a culture that can ruin you, but there exists such a company- Amazon My management changed every month.

This results in either re-organizing bins or walking around trying to find less cramped ones, especially for large items. Facility is huge which cuts into break/lunch times.

If you are moderately ok at the job, you will be tasked with it more and more, instead of the job you were hired to do.

The company talks about safety and doesn't allow hourly associates to work 12 hour days because of this. However, managers are expected to work 14 to 16 hour days every day (I have seen 20 hour days at times). There is no concern for a managers well being or personal life. Hourly associates can unionize and managers cannot - could that be the reason? Managers rarely get a moment to even eat a quick lunch. When this is brough up to senior management, the response is that it is OUR FAULT because we aren't managing our time well enough. Huh? Wasn't it you that added so much to our workload that no human could possibly complete? Oh yes, and hundreds of e-mails each day as well. You are expected to not be at your computer, but you are also expected to know everything that is e-mailed within minutes. (Sorry, not psychic) Amazon treats every manager as expendable and has about 50% to 75% management turnover each year from what I have seen. Yes, REALLY!!! At annual review time, 10% of managers are put on a Performance Improvement Plan, regardless of their individual contributions. I have seen managers who were railroaded out and degraded along the way. But the year prior they were the superstar. How did that happen? You better be in that top 90% or you will likely lose your job. Most of the other managers will be told they are doing a crappy job too. Only the top tier which is about 10% will be told they are doing a good job. Nothing like a bunch of negative reinforcement to de-motivate a management team. Start treating managers like human beings.",-0.3223111,-16.838858,-0.0361274963386349,0.08525949347903004,1.0,0.105127688172043,0.4611290322580645

Amazon is a good company, but it has its faults just like any other company. I would recommend it. Spend more time with your associates. They are the ones doing the work and know the processes.

23196,amazon,2014,"Maybe it will look good on your resume. There are a lot of data and you may be able to do an interesting analysis (only if you are patient enough to wait for your query to run, see below). Work-life balance was not bad for me. There are a few smart and honest people. Almost everything I wanted to say is in this review by another ""research scientist II"" on Aug 11, 2014 (Glassdoor does not allow a link in the review, filter reviews with ""research scientist II""). Noise level is terrible because of overcrowded office with ridiculously noisy SDEs who have no notion that there may be somebody who needs a quiet environment for his work. We don't have access to academic journals and conference papers, and we need to ask people in academia to get a copy, which I believe is against the policy of publishers. 3yr vesting of 401k matching contributions was what I did not know before I left and what I regret the most.  Amazon claims itself to be the world's most costumer-centric company. That in turn implies it does not care much about the employees. Basically, employees are dispensable and replaceable.  Company is not investing enough for its internal infrastructures, because they are not directly connected to customer satisfaction. Databases have much less processing capacity than what is needed, the situation worsened much more since 2013 and it is not a surprise if it takes more than a few hours to run a very simple SQL query. I wonder how people, especially data scientist type of people, do their work with such a poor environment.  Note that work environments for research scientists may be quite different depending on what area you are in. For machine learning and computer vision researchers, the company seems to be relaxing its strict policy on publications. However, on more traditional supply chain area that I was in, nothing seems to be changing, after all, we are probably not doing state-of-the-art research that is worth publishing. We are just coming up with ad-hoc patches for problems, without understanding anything and accumulating any knowledge.  Promotions are rare and it looks tougher for research scientists compared to SDEs. While SDEs have clearer measurements on their work, it is often unclear how to measure the contribution of research scientists' work. Management, which is dominated by MBA-type of people, does not understand the value of long-term research and they are only looking at short-term cost savings, which are often estimated based on dubious calculations using inaccurate financial figures.  There is no career path for research scientists. Internal transfers to other groups should be a good opportunity for employees to grow, but from my experiences, people are generally narrow-minded and reject you when you do not have past experiences in the exact area, even if you have good records of performance reviews. They basically treat you as just another external candidate.  One last thing. My employment was terminated 2 days after I submitted a formal letter of resignation, even though I was requesting to leave one week later. Not only I lost 1 week of income, I also lost health insurance coverage one month earlier, because I would have been covered until the end of month if I quitted in the beginning of the month as I planned, but they have ""fired"" me in the end of previous month and the insurance was terminated at the same time.

The culture hates developers and treats them like second-class citizens. Due to Jeff Bezos's obsession with miserliness (which he mistakenly calls ""frugality"") you will be given one standard monitor, one slow desktop, and one slow laptop with not enough RAM. If you want anything else, take it from an intern's desk after he/she leaves, or buy it yourself.  In the same vein, funding to fix ""developer pain"" issues is non-existent. Could everyone's job satisfaction or productivity be vastly improved by having a few developers work on environment, tooling, or build system issues? Doesn't matter! You can either voluntarily spend your free time working on it, or do without. Actually lots of business-critical internal tooling is maintained this way, by ""volunteers"".

They love to strong-arm engineering managers into committing to dates for project launches without spending an appropriate amount of time investigating and scoping out the work.

It's gotten to the point that we have business code no one understands or is willing to touch, simply by ""death by a thousand cuts"" with no time ever allocated for refactoring.

Your results will NOT matter.  - They will fire you and ask you to pay back a proportion of sign-on bonus and relocation... So be careful.

23271,amazon,2014,"Amazon as a company is growing rapidly. It's going into new markets and challenging big players as well as innovating in markets where it's already quite ahead. There is no dearth of choice when you are working at Amazon. There are a number of teams working on different products across all sorts of areas.  The best part is that the work which you do will get shipped.  That's the main thing which I love about Amazon. Software you write will see light of day in say 6 months. That's how quickly things move here. Teams are small and ownership is more. Process is lightweight and will never hinder you. I have never been asked to fill in time-sheets or made to give hourly estimates. People are friendly. Technical arguments are settled based on data and with respect.  Amazon does most of its development in Java and uses a lot of open-source software. This frees engineers to focus on problems rather than re-engineer software which already exists.  Although some teams have poor work-life balance, the ones which I have worked in had no such problems. I have been able to do a 9-5 on most days without any work carrying over to the weekends. The rapid growth of Amazon and increasing head counts have put a lot of pressure on the buildings which house Amazon employees. Many Amazon buildings are packed. Seating is cramped and elevator rides can be too close for comfort.  Career growth is hard. Starting developers enter at SDE 1 with a clear path to SDE 2, but from there on out it's hard to get to SDE 3 or above. Employees on immigrant work visas like H1B should know that Amazon does not start your permanent residency process till you hit SDE 2 (level 5). This is where sometimes politics rears its ugly head. You might find really hard working engineers play the game.  Amazon does not give you additional perks if you compare it with companies like Microsoft or Google.

23274,amazon,2014,"Well it's Amazon so work is steady though so steady income & tons of OT come Christmas Holiday. Day one insurance is nice too. You'll most likely bond with your new hire class & meet other really great people that are at the same level as you within your department. The bad/ugly side of Amazon is coming out slowly but surely, ie. BBC, Forbes & Business Weekly have all done undercover investigations & reports on their facilities. Training doesn't exist I was thrown to the ""wolves"" in both departments that I worked in, along with my fellow new hires, & was expected (on a curve) to obtain 100% immediately. The pay for what we accomplish on a daily basis is pathetic. To make $11.00/ hour while the average package that is boxed up & shipped out ranges from $10 - $200+ & that's at an average of 1 package per every 60-65 seconds. Health insurance though it's day one to ""blue badges"" is not all that great. I have never received so many bills from hospitals after paying $150 co-pay upon leaving. There are different options for health insurance & trust me we are not on the low grade plan & we still have paid more out than under any other company's insurance. 85% of the management team consists of recent college grads & they have ""Zero"" life, management & people skills to be expected to manage teams of 60+ individuals successfully. I have never been treated so rudely, cut off, ignored & had an ""education"" touted over my head in all of my life up to now. The older more veteran managers tend to be great however Amazon is not their home & usually great promoted from within or find work elsewhere. 85% of the jobs are on a ""rate"" system which is completely flawed for they gauge the 100% expectation of a mean based of the average high percentage & then lowest percentage rates. This system is flawed because you'll have the seasoned employees ""cherry picking"" work in order to exceed rate while everyone else struggles to make rate for the only work that is left for others to do is the more challenging/difficult & low numbered items. In certain departments you even have the individuals that are in a non rate position (support role) cherry picking & aiding their personal friends feeding them the good work & giving you garbage. NO DEFINED CAREER PATH, PERIOD. There are so many positions but there is no clear cut ""career path"" to really aim for. There are positions that one can move into but it comes with more responsibility with no more pay & these positions are usually filled on the ""buddy system"" more so then someone earning it based off of hard work. No forgiveness when it comes to restroom breaks. We understand you're one of the world's largest on line retailer but if it comes down to ""messing"" myself or getting the customer their item(s) I'm sorry the item will be delayed but management doesn't get this & either writes up individuals or threatens with write ups. Not every bodily function can be timed out to be during your break/lunch time. Amazon has 4 types of people under the roof, Amazon (blue badge), temp agency (white badge), security & contracted cleaning company (yellow badge). Everyone outside of blue badge is treated poorly by everyone including department managers. It's shameful & degrading to see & hear the things that take place. They are people too that need to earn a paycheck just as everyone else. Provide better health insurance, training & pay for your employees. Make a different structure to clocking rates & what individuals are doing to keep work fair & even. Hire more within. Just because someone comes to Amazon with a BA does not qualify them as a department manager. I've seen department PA's that don't have a degree be the only reason a department is successful because they're carrying the inexperienced, yet educated, management staff. Understand that we are humans & not a number producing a number. We have children, illness, bodily functions that sometimes take us out for a few minutes if not a full day but that's just part of life. My wife missed her grandfather's funeral due to Mandatory OT & I asked to be pardoned from this OT but was denied due to grandfather in laws were not covered under Amazon bereavement policy (I even advised I didn't want to receive any kind of pay just have the day in order to care for our children). Make a clear defined career path, not just tier one to tier 3 to PA to management if you're lucky. The people I work with are full of life & ideas but as soon as they step into that warehouse & scan their badge to work it's like they become zombies. The work is uneventful, uninspiring & non rewarding top that off with no hope to move/progress into one of the few other roles you offer makes life miserable.

23289,amazon,2014,"The only reason to work here is that it will improve your future prospects of getting a better job elsewhere. Recruiters know that Amazon has a high hiring bar and employees are motivated to leave. In rare cases and for rare individuals, you will have the opportunity to build something awesome, for everyone else, it is duct tape and bailing wire to survive Christmas. If you can work somewhere else, you most likely should.  To start with, the work environment is soul crushing and more stressful than working in an airport terminal. The noise level is so great that you will need to wear headphones throughout the day. I worked in buildings which were so overcrowded that you often had to wait for three elevators to find one you could squeeze onto. I am sure that they were in violation of the fire code.  For scientists, you will drain your human capital and have little opportunity to learn new skills or deepen your knowledge. Don't even ask about getting Amazon to pay for journal subscription -- you are expected to scrounge papers from friends still in academia or off the Internet. The ""mentors"" I had were largely useless and it is virtually impossible to earn a promotion without superhuman efforts, i.e., having no work-live balance. In addition, there is a culture of micromanagement which comes down from the top. This attitude makes it difficult to research and to solve important problems which are costing the company millions. And, this is not limited to a single manger -- I had five in two years, all of whom were worse than any manager I had in my 25-year career prior to Amazon.  When you attempt to make changes, it can take six months or more of politicking and fighting the Agile/scrum schedule to launch your improvement into production. Amazon takes the leadership principles seriously, but ""Deliver Results"" and ""Bias for Action"" trump everything, even correctness. No one seems to remember who made $50MM mistakes, but they do remember who didn't deliver the XYZ feature on time by giving up endless evenings and weekends.  Next, read the fine print on everything you sign. Amazon has many pernicious ways of clawing back money from you when you leave, e.g., you must stay two years to avoid repaying relocation expenses and you will only receive matching contributions to your 401(k) if you stay three years.  In addition, the infrastructure is ""frugal"" and often unreliable. If you work in retail and need to run a query in Q4, it can take a day or more to run.  Finally, when the market turns against Amazon -- and it will -- the stock will take a major haircut because of the insane P/E ratio. Employees are stakeholders, too -- investing in them should payoff. Most of the MBAs I encountered make the work environment worse and are huge waste of salary: they could easily be replaced, in most cases, by software and B-grade undergraduates, who at least would know how to write SQL.

23294,amazon,2014,"Amazon will teach you a lot. You'll be around brilliant people all day and are bound to learn something new from them, even if you pick it up by osmosis.  The things you do are likely to ship. Not everything does, as with every company, some projects get canned or put on hold indefinitely, but most things move pretty quickly. Even if your particular project never sees the light of day, it's likely that some of the things you did will get repurposed.  You'll have a pretty good idea of where you fit into the machine based on your job title and the people around you. This isn't the sort of place where you're going it alone and everyone is siloed off, there are literally thousands of people who can answer questions or collaborate.  If you meet or exceed ""the bar"", you will be recognised to a degree. In most cases, effort in equals reward out.  Being so process-heavy can actually be a blessing in disguise as resources are always available for any problems you might run into and things are fairly well-documented.  Amazon gets things done and one of the key values is having a backbone -- you're expected to stand your ground if you disagree. This lends itself extremely well to things like eliminating code debt and keeping things moving, there's no groupthink. It can sometimes become a little bit adversarial, but it's not a big issue and is a small price to pay for the advantage it gives the organisation. For a huge company, it's outright nimble.  Everything is data-driven, which I'll also mention in the Cons section. As a pro, though, if you have the data to back it up, you'll be able to get what you want. Additionally, your performance is measured with data-driven metrics, so your review shouldn't come as a surprise -- good or bad. I hope you took pictures of your work-life balance while you had it, because it's gone the second you step in the door. If you're not in the office until 2 in the morning some nights, you're probably not meeting the bar. This is an unfortunate fact.  Salary is average, perks are nil, and bureaucracy is outrageous (though you have to expect the latter in a company of 89,000 people).  ""The bar"" is either something you stand on or it hangs over your head. Not ""raising the bar"" means you're toast eventually. Amazon has a monumental turnover rate, most people will give up after a year.  Office politics happen, largely in the form of needing to suck up to the right people in order to be heard and having to manipulate colleagues to get them on your side. Again, fairly common in an organisation this big.  Everything is data-driven. You can't go on instinct or gut feeling, if you don't have the data, you don't have an argument. Your experience means nothing if you don't have data to back it up.  If something comes down from Jeff, people drop everything in order to kowtow -- which would be fine if it wasn't completely inconsistent with Amazon's stated values. You might lose your job for daring to argue with the decisions of a hypercompetent genius from Mars, but if you want to be consistent with having backbone, that's a chance you have to take. The fabled ""question mark emails"" mean someone's not sleeping for the next two weeks. I know Jeff is a visionary-slash-juggernaut, but he is not omniscient and sometimes questioning his judgment is a good thing, even if it's just to suss out why something is being done a certain way.  Your people are people, not cogs. Your turnover rate is abysmal, start with fixing the work-life balance and you'll see your turnover rate improve.

23301,amazon,2014,"- Many smart people who are good to work with - Opportunity to work on interesting projects, at scale My review is about what it's like to be a business contributor at Amazon. This could be a marketing manager, category leader, product manager, project manager, etc. I will begin with the assumption that great business contributors want to do two things: 'Produce New Ideas' (better ways of doing things, new initiatives), and 'Drive Change'. Now I'll explain why Amazon's environment is essentially hostile to both. The consequence for many business contributors is burnout.  ""High Standards"" has devolved into Endless Fault-Finding -- Amazon suffers from a somewhat unique culture of ""high standards"". Never have I seen a supposed corporate value become so abused. There is precious little innovation in Amazon retail over the last 5 years and much of this owes to the endless nitpicking masquerading as ""high standards"". Amongst executives especially, there is a competition as to who has the highest IQ. This is demonstrated by who has the most effective takedown of a proposed idea, which is usually distributed in the form of a document read during meetings. In this warped culture, an executive would expose himself as a ""naif"" by praising a proposed idea. Instead, ""clarifying questions' and critiques rule. A Simon Cowell impersonation contest ensues. What does this mean for new ideas? It means that to merely suggest a better way of doing things means to be attacked - ""Why didn't you propose this earlier? You've been working here for X years already"", ""Why isn't the team already doing this?"", ""You could do A, B, C, D differently, your analysis on ___ is sloppy and incomplete"".  ….Or their favorite- ""Get MORE data"". Executives don't understand how convoluted the process is of getting accurate data at Amazon because they always have someone to fetch it for them. Amazon not only does not use 3rd party analytics packages, they don't even have an effective proprietary system for dashboarding data or pulling metrics. Most of the requests are done by hand through SQL across a myriad of poorly documented tables in which the data fields are not well understood. Trying to understand what different fields means, requires you to file a ticket - which is sometimes never responded to. Once you prepare the data set, any minor variance in the data is justification, according to executives, that ""you don't understand the underlying dynamics of what you're proposing"". ""High Standards"" has become a tour de force of fault-finding and needless perfectionism that totally deters new idea development at Amazon. Why suggest a new idea or better way of doing things? You know you are signing yourself up for data pull after data pull, document after document, harangued at meeting after meeting. After the initiative is actually implemented, you will never be thanked for the contribution the initiative makes. Instead, other stakeholders will find fault with it, and complain to your manager, who will be all too receptive and that they ""have been concerned about these same issues for some time"". Sadly, this gives a glimpse as to why many business managers at Amazon end up doing bare minimum because being a change agent is filled with pitfalls and very few positives.  Executives do not Engage Business Mangers in Ways that are Productive --  Although mileage may vary on different teams, I believe, in general, Amazon values executives and engineers. Executives mistakenly assume they have all the judgment thats required, and all underling business managers are good for is supplying them with data so they can apply their ""brilliant minds"". Of course, they lack context for all the categories and channels that these decisions require, but that doesn't bother them. They respect engineers because engineers have a kind of knowledge they know they don't, and engineers can always retreat into arcane aspects of tech that are impenetrable to executives. I have never seen a company where executives so totally engage their subordinates at the wrong level. What I mean by this is executives are told to ""dive deep"" and understand the details- an impossible task when they manage dozens or hundreds of people. So what ends up happening is they attempt to micro-manage teams in areas of the business they simply DO NOT have command over. What they do NOT do, unfortunately, is take the time to ask questions of their various business manager to better understand the business, or engage at a high level and try to ascertain if there are significant business opportunities we are not addressing. That might add some value, but they don't do that. Instead, absent context, they launch into highly opinionated monologues on what we should be doing, or play ""gotcha"" with minor errors they spot in the document. You will quickly find out these are not mutual conversations but rather 1-way statements. The other favorite thing to do during business reviews is to not discuss the business, but discuss the layout, formatting, and descriptions in the document itself -- as though that is best use of people's time. Amazon executives enjoy raising their voice at subordinates and are the worst at listening I have ever seen at a major company. Listening is apparently not a valued skill. What transpires is Micro-Management without context. It is a pointless kind of engagement that adds no value. Worse, it squanders entirely the domain expertise of business experts that Amazon has brought on board. There could potentially be excellent synergy between the domain knowledge business contributors have and strategic mindset that executives have -- but that won't happen the way current interactions take place at Amazon. Managers are often indifferent towards major issues confronting the business but lash out in anger at seemingly minor details, a haphazard form of review that leave subordinates unable to understand exactly the priorities of the business.  Politics and Consequences --  Business contributors burnout at a blistering place at Amazon. In my group alone, almost HALF of the business headcount have left the team in ONE year. At the same time, most of the engineers and executives have remained. Business managers often don't have the tools to their job, with inadequate analytics and few methods to improve an ailing part of the business. One of the more unfortunate aspects, which further deters action, is that Amazon can be very political. Most teams are ""2 pizza teams"" - meaning they are self-sufficient. You can easily spend 90% of your time with your own team. But this means that other teams become RELUCTANT to collaborate. They have their own priorities and often don't need you for anything. Let's say you have a Project X which had a dependency that another team owns. When you approach them to make modifications to aid your department, they may well resent this attempted shift in priorities. Now the very manager who told you to deal with a dependency that another team manages, who pushed you to get this other team to change, also is the one who finds fault with you when the other team objects that your intervention is not appreciated. The manager will tell you to orchestrate change WITHOUT anyone balking, which I suppose is easy enough for a manger who himself does not orchestrate change, but largely reviews documents. Given that much has been written about Amazon's ""gladiator culture"", it is silly to think rank and file can go out into the environment and make change happen without ruffling a few feathers. Without adequate support of subordinates, employees will simply stop attempting to drive change with other teams. And many have. When I first joined Amazon, I was surprised how many business contributors avoided the inter-department negotiations necessary to move things along, now it's all too clear (note sometimes this push-back will come from one's own team- and management will be indifferent to the hostile team dynamics). Management has created a no-win situation for that kind of activity. One reason for this disconnect-- Managers themselves often focus on 'strategic initiatives' which have S-team buy-in so different teams have already prioritized that work. Managers who work on these initiatives experience harmony across teams, but can't seem to understand that other initiatives (which are not prioritized by the consumer leadership team company-wide) don't have the built-in support. So when they see there is tension, this contrasts with the smooth cross-team relations they are used to seeing. It's a kind of myopia that hampers cross-team collaboration, the kind that really requires teams to collaborate when it's not dictated from above.  Accomplishments are Lost in the Noise --  The emphasis on fault finding at Amazon culturally prevents the opposite at Amazon - to celebrate an individual or even a team's job well done. The consequence however is that there is little difference between a business manager who treads water versus one who swims a 100M record. Provided a business manger works effectively on a few projects that are deemed important by senior management, that is sufficient. The lack of recognition by management and executives for standout work has become the undoing of morale at the company for business contributors. This may be stereotypical, but engineers can often subsist on challenging work and peer recognition by other engineers. When business contributors go above and beyond, if their accomplishments are simply seen as another bullet point on a document or a brief mention at an annual review, there simply isn't enough incentive. You will always have some % of contributors who will plough forward regardless, but even for them it's a matter of time before the lack of recognition will have them seeking greener pastures.  The reviews saying Amazon is cheap with its employees are true. But they suggest Amazon withholds perks from employees which cost money such as snacks, or events, or bonuses. In truth, I feel like this matters, but not nearly as much as the fact that Amazon is stingy with things that don't cost money -- like recognition and support (support might be your manager vouching for your work rather than undercutting it at every opportunity when criticism is received from other teams or executives). Instead, Amazon goes to great lengths to diminish people's accomplishments, ignoring their successes, attempting to diffuse individual achievements across a team so as to prevent individuals from receiving credit (and critique the individual as ""selfish"" if they try to claim a hand in that success).  What would Valuing your Employees more Mean? --  Amazon's position in the market has allowed it to develop a sub-optimal culture, one that henpecks people for suggesting better ways of doing things, which goads him or her to ""prove it"" using inadequate tools, endlessly faults them, and then ultimately is indifferent towards the resulting improvement. It has management that, all too often, is unaccountable - that does not participate in collaborative exchanges with its team, but rather reads documents and directs ""feedback"". Management is largely indifferent to team progress that doesn't align with S-team goals, but much of the company's success owes to progress in these other areas.  I don't think the answer is ""free beer"" or company lunches. It may one day dawn on Amazon leadership that finding ways to SUPPORT promising ideas and efforts are just as important as critiquing them. That it's management's job to ensure employees have what they need to do the job: that means adequate analytics and tools, assistance in gaining cooperation of other teams, ensuring effective dynamics on the team itself, ensuring quality processes and removing obstacles… even something trivial like making sure that is actually possible to book a meeting room without 5 days notice. That management has value to add to the team, and there is more to do than disappear and work on 'strategic' initiatives. Ultimately, I think valuing employees means respecting that business managers are domain experts and it is their expertise that you are hiring them for, their knowledge and judgment, that the value of that team comes from matching executive strategic insight with it. That requires management & executives to be humble enough to ask questions and have collaborative exchanges and God forbid, ask what a business manager's judgment is on a particular issue when there are different options available. To recognize that business contributors are there for more than simply providing details or fetching data. Great workers may want compensation, but I think they want recognition of their contribution and their abilities more than anything. Providing that costs nothing, only a shift in mindset.  Absent any change, Amazon's environment is a recipe for burnout for business contributors. The company will keep hemorrhaging quality people, having them leave not long after they've begun to master the learning curve in the organization, replacing them with new people who will follow the same cycle- preventing the company from benefitting from its mid-level personnel. More work for recruiters I'm sure. Lack of executive concern towards attrition of business contributors will have a cost- one they may find out too late. The tragedy is the situation is reversible - but indifference, owing largely to Amazon's dominant position in the marketplace, will likely prevent it.

At Tier I you will have very little access to your manager, training beyond the initial orientation, and resources unless you are willing to go in on your own time and explore because if you are dormant for more than 5 minutes you are in trouble. However if you do take the time to do that, the resources are fairly wide open on the intranet, but you are NEVER told at Tier I how to access them, and if you bring what you have learned up, you will get looks like ""how do YOU know that, or the Tier IV managers will get pissed you know something they don't. PS they did away with Tier II, so if you do get to be more than a drone with added responsibilities, you will not get paid for it unless you magically jump to tier III. There is a lot of confusion at Tier I. Many times the different managers have totally different ways of doing things and this is a symptom of a greater problem. There is no clear advancement path from Tier I to the higher tiers unless a manager just happens to take favor with you. I assume that this is what tier II used to be for. Clear and concise directions, expectations, and training are missing at Tier I if you want to advance. I recommend that they restore Tier II and use it for those associates that shine at Tier one when they have a secondary task added. Have written descriptions of the secondary jobs and hoe those job interlink for particular paths of advancement. Also, when additional tasks are added a small increase in pay should be given. Because much of the normal advancement steps are missing, you must jump up the corporate ladder, and you'll only make it if you have someone who favors you personally because there is no tracking of training and evaluation in those step positions.

23388,amazon,2014,"Amazon as a whole is a great company, but only worth joining in the right departments.  The good news is you can move after a year. If you go into AWS Support, work on networking and self promotion outside of AWS Support, then get out as fast as you can. *Never tell anybody you hate support. It's important one pretends to like AWS Support, then transfer as soon as possible.*  If your transfer doesn't work out after a year in AWS Support, you still have a deeply discounted relocation to the Pacific Northwest or Northern Virginia thanks to Amazon. Expect to pay some back if you leave before 2 years, indentured servitude is central to the retention strategy. Many departments are terrible. I stupidly joined AWS Support as an stepping stone into Amazon when I should have waited for the job I wanted instead of waiting to transfer. During the interview, they will say over and over, ""this is not a call center!"" It's a call center, a very densely packed call center. If you want to be a star, you stay at your desk and respond to as many customers as possible. Don't forget to praise your managers, they have no idea what's going on or what you do, they might not even know where they are most days, but they go crazy for giving them the same insincere praise they give each other and employees.  The job is easy, they don't want people who can think and they've done very well in hiring the people they want. The entire job is linking to documentation or external blogs. Most of the customers are lazy, hence the need to pay somebody to Google phrases on their behalf. As long as you make the customer believe they are special and you care, you might get a 5-star rating, which is very serious in AWS Support. You don't have to do a good job, you just have to make the customer think you did something special to get that 5-star. Then your manager will give you a pat on the head, you'll oblige their condescension by feigning appreciation for their rote praise.  If you get a 1-star rating, your managers will remind you of your terrible inadequacy. It doesn't matter why you get a 1-star, just that you did. They usually don't investigate the 1-star, you're told to have more ""Customer Obsession"" or some other such nonsense. It's the same coin as the 5-stars, just a different side of the same coin. Nobody bothers to understand why you have a 1- or 5-star rating, they just give false praise for 5-star rating or sincere, but ignorant, condemnation for 1-star ratings. From this, I realized most managers could be replaced with simple scripts that send a predefined message on IRC for 1- and 5-star ratings. The desks AWS Support could recover from newly automated managers would each seat four more support engineers.  Literally anything goes to get the desired numbers. ""Engineers"" are encouraged to get many ""actions"", if that involves writing as many short emails as possible, that's good if it creates more ""actions."" No matter what a customer asks, everything is working well and every product is completely without flaws. Never give cautionary advice about AWS services, if a customer asks about a potential downside do whatever you can to avoid admitting any imperfections.  The pay and benefits are terrible. There's no tuition reimbursement, the 401(k) is bad, the pay is low, the vacation days are few, the health insurance is almost worthless, and you get an insultingly poor Amazon.com discount code.

23511,amazon,2014,"Amazon is a resume-maker, make no doubt about it. Within months of having updated my LinkedIn profile, I had recruiters from Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others reaching out (I ended up interviewing at several and jumping ship to Microsoft). I'm sure this is partly due to fact of Amazon's reputation as being not the most pleasant place to work (so its employees are receptive to an 'out' more than some others) and because they are known to have a high bar for hiring..  It's also full of very smart people (though many of them are not nearly as smart as they *think* they are) and you get to work on big, challenging problems.  Lastly, their publicly professed focus on the customer is absolutely legitimate. It was great to see how they approached this from the inside as it's something I think Amazon gets uniquely right in the tech industry. Amazon, like other big companies, will never present a uniform experience. Your experiences will depend on the team you join. There were a lot of people on my team who wanted nothing more than to get out but I have other friends who actually are fairly happy there. That said, there is some uniformity of the culture that has its origin in Bezos Darwinian worldview. The best advice I can give is to read the book The Everything Store as I think it nails the culture. Personally, I found it quite unpleasant. It is a harshly critical environment. Work environments that challenge you to be your best are great, but it seemed nearly pathological at Amazon. Anything I did was corrected by at least 4-5 people whether or not it merited it, partly so they could show off how they were *better* and partly because it's an ingrained part of the culture. One of the Amazon Principles are 'Are Right. A Lot'. I think the corollary to this is many Amazon employees think everyone else is always wrong and feel the need to constantly tell you. It gets pretty old fast. At first I took this personally and thought maybe I was just a screw up but when I started paying more attention I realized EVERYONE received this treatment.  Amazon is also the kind of place that will use you up and spit you out if you let it. I've worked at true start-ups in my twenties and put in hours that would put most of the folks even at Amazon to shame. In doing so, I learned what my limits were, how much of my life I was willing to sacrifice to work, and that ultimately I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. As such, I was well equipped to manage my work load and still be successful. I didn't work crazy hours or get too stressed out. But I saw those that had not had such an experience, and the often ended up worked into the ground because they didn't know how to draw the line at some point.  Lastly, Amazon is an extremely chaotic place. Many people who work there like to delude themselves into thinking it functions similarly to a start-up (anyone who has worked at a real start-up will immediately tell you it isn't really like one at all). The problem is, it's a huge company. And when a company exceeds a certain size, it *gasp* actually needs a bit more uniformity in process and coordinated long-term planning. Instead, Amazon makes pretensions to process but kind of lets teams do their own thing. Frequently, there is process, but it varies by team or if you actually use the 'official' process it just means you won't accomplish what you need to as you'll be mired in some dead-end path. The idea of being 'start-up like' like or 'scrappy' is wonderful in theory for such a big company, but in practice it just doesn't work. Amazon wasn't even particularly fast in pushing out new features, which is presumably the point of such an ethos.  Lastly, the comp really isn't that great. It's okay, but the benefits are mediocre at best, the base salaries are just average (I knew what a number of people were making from having discussed it) and much is locked up in stock that vests over years. It's basically a golden cage designed to keep people at the company despite how miserable most of them are.  And that's the thing I'd really impress on prospective hires, it was very rare I perceived anyone to be truly *happy* to be there. For my part, I did a year and got out. Not because it was unbearably difficult or the worst job ever, it just wasn't a particularly pleasant or rewarding place to be. I think if you know what you're getting into the cost/benefit is there, you get to see the company from the inside, work on big problems, and work with a ton of smart people. But it's not a place I could ever see staying more than a couple years unless you had no other option. Show your employees you value them rather than see them as commodities to be used up and thrown away. Ditch the abrasive, hyper-critical culture, the unnecessary long hours, and focus on making sure they have a pleasant experience. You cannot hire quick enough to make up for the massive attrition you guys have and eventually it will catch up with you.",9.7592125,-7.400749,0.020742518549821093,0.06952332264746966,2.0,0.20003486097236095,0.5602879065379065

23559,amazon,2014,"You can bring your dog to work. Sadly that is the only good thing I can say about this company. You may meet some smart and amazing people, but not at the upper management level. Please keep in mind this review comes from the viewpoint of a Brand Specialist. I can't speak for the software developers, those in other segments outside of the Amazon.com retail business (for example Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, or company subsidiaries), or those not in the corporate HQ in Seattle (such as fulfillment center associates).  - Zero work/life balance. Everyone is expected to take their work home. Management pretends to care and tells you to not overwork, but if you don't work weekends you'll get fired. I've received a phone call at 4 AM from work. Insane infringement on your personal life.  - The culture is toxic. On average people quit after just two years. That isn't normal for any company. It's a revolving door. After just one year of employment, half my team was already junior to me. People either quit or get fired. Everyone is afraid of getting fired and discuss it frequently when management isn't around. It's really sad.  - The company is incredibly disorganized, the work day is chaotic. There is an appalling lack of training, people don't know how to do their jobs and are being taught by others who have only been with the company for a grand total of 3 months. The tools you need to do your job are poorly developed and often break down or have limited usefulness, leading to unnecessary low productivity which you are blamed for. Systems are constantly changing and no one knows how to use the new versions - some people like this because they want innovation, but the truth is the company is so large now that you really don't have much freedom to innovate. There is a huge clash between a start-up mentality and a bureaucratic corporate culture.  - Management is poor quality, and downright nasty. Many are not qualified to do their job, lacking proper experience. For instance, some were on a management rotational program that put them in 3 very different roles over 3 short years, while they had no background in any of those functions. It was a joke working under those types because they knew just as much about their job as you did. I witnessed senior managers being brought into the company and being ""trained"" by their reports. Upper level management is completely inhumane - they treat people like machines / slaves / farm animals, despite that many of my peers were incredibly bright and talented people from strong backgrounds and with good educations (Ivy leagues and other Top 25 schools). Management never recognized people for their contributions and hard work, leading to low morale.  In summary, I'd say that the high employee turnover is evidence enough of the lack of work/life balance and the toxic and chaotic work environment perpetuated by bad management. As I mentioned above, after just one year, I was already more senior than half my team. Everyone I had known was gone, and I was training the newcomers. Think about that. Improve the culture, starting with improving yourselves (I'm talking to you, management). Some changes will take time but are possible, such as fixing the shoddy tools and providing sensible training. But you can start by simply being nicer human beings - that takes no time at all. Start treating your employees with respect - you've got incredibly smart and talented individuals who can, and do, move on to other companies if you don't treat them properly. Amazon wants top talent but is creating a bad reputation as an employer. I've talked to plenty of Ivy league-ers and students at top MBA schools who don't want to work for Amazon. Fix that. If you don't know how, start by listening to your employees. Heck, you might even want to read my review above.",-6.739125,-6.548328,-0.03523722744448606,0.028410997870558726,1.0,0.03283644717855244,0.49773315865421136

Four ten hour days, three days off. - Shifts. The opportunity to change shifts as your schedule deems fit. - Leadership. Through the Ambassador program, Amazon offers entry level 'leadership skills', welcoming new associates into the company/dept. - Workload. The amount of work week to week 'weeds out' unproductive workers, most of the time. - Technology and Efficiency. Amazon has streamlined the processes where almost anyone can succeed at their job. Its almost (almost) stupid proof, and usually easily correctable when a mistake is made. - Benefits. Very cheap and start almost immediately after hire date. - Opportunity. Amazon offers the opportunity to open new facilities around the country. They will pay your travel, lodging, meals and overtime pay for the duration of your assignment. This is also your best option for promotion. Amazon offers an attractive compensation package that pays for moving expenses to open new facilities. - Overtime. Especially around holidays, the company expects you to work mandatory 50-60 hour weeks. To quote something I read on Facebook: 'Amazon, where you OD on OT.' - Schedule. During 'peak', those ten hour shifts get longer and longer. - Pay. I'd call it 'adequate', but not enough for the amount of work the company asks of you. - 'Bonus'. The 'monthly bonus' is calculated on the FC as a whole. So, the person making 80% gets the same paycheck as the person making 180%. Aside from 'positive feedback', the company does not recognize individual achievement when calculating this monthly 'bonus'. - Management. I have been working since I was 16 years old, and have never seen this much management turnover in my life. My department alone has gone through four managers and 'leads' in the last 18 months. I can't keep up with all the senior management turnover. - Turnover. Not a huge problem in my dept, but as a whole, Amazon has a large turnover rate, more so than most my previous jobs combined. Its hard work, long hours, not friendly to families or the elderly. - Constant Change. While this is a condition we signed up for, management is very unclear and nontransparent when it comes to such change. They observe you working with a stop watch and pedometer for a week, turn your dept upside down, raise rates, then expect you to 'adapt' and learn the new process. - Promotion, or lack thereof. The competition for these jobs are fierce, and graded on some kind of point system. Most of the time, the most qualified fail this system and the least qualified candidate gets the position. Despite the companies claim to transparency, the veil of secrecy surrounding these jobs remains shrouded. - Listen to your associates more often. We know the job, do it everyday, some inclusion in radical redesign of layout and procedures would be nice. - There needs to be more transparency when it comes to promotion opportunities. - The monthly 'bonus' should include individual achievements.

23629,amazon,2014,"Amazon is widely seen as one of few companies that are actively innovating. An Amazon.com stint on your resume can open some doors that might otherwise remain closed to you.  Amazon stock has done amazingly well over the past few years and Amazon is a big believer in paying with stock, with one of the lowest base salary caps in the industry.  As a development manager, I had more authority over my team's processes, the hiring process, the review process, etc., than I had at most of the other companies I've worked for. This can be good or bad, depending on the quality of the individual manager. Conspicuously absent from the company's core values are such things as ""honesty,"" ""work-life balance,"" and ""treat employees fairly.""  The company is frugal to the point of stupidity at times, with some calling this out as being ""frupid."" Getting access to such things as proper hardware and training took an enormous amount of work since there is a severely limited budget for both.  The middle layer of management, from SDM to Director, has a lot of power to do whatever they wish. How you are treated at Amazon depends almost entirely on your manager. With a good manager, you'll do well. With a rotten manager, and there are a lot of them, you'll do poorly. This includes such things as work-life balance, compensation, and advancement.  The company has grown faster than its processes support. All too often, enormous technical debt accrues and fighting to pay back that debt is far more difficult than it should be, as the VPs only want features.  Excessive upper management meddling in various projects causes a lot of problems, from features that change on a daily basis to features added without any schedule change or any other features removed, and so on. The upper management team, all the way to Bezos, has to sign off on all user experience changes for the major features, tablets, and eInk readers, and that causes a terrible backlog in getting those features defined, as they go through multiple iterations at multiple upper management levels.  Basic project management guidelines, best practices, and tenets are routinely violated. The lessons of ""The Mythical Man-Month"" have never been learned at Amazon.  The stock is likely overvalued, which means that the generous compensation can turn overnight to a much less generous compensation. Stop meddling so much.

It's wearing on employee morale, and there has been a distinct loss of vision. Long time employees with great knowledge, ambition, and a passion for what they do are leaving in droves because the negativity and loss of balance with home/family are becoming too much to bear. In my last year with Amazon, there was a lot of discussion about remedying those, assurances that VP's/SVP's cared about those long-time people and retaining them.

In other words: You are always working on a fragile environment that routinely goes down entirely for no apparent reason. Countless hours are burned trying to recover your environment. Tremendously disruptive because there is almost always somebody dealing with their broken environment.  Best practices are not followed: - There are few tests, and it takes lots of hacking just to get unit tests in place (forget about IT/functional/e2e as they use prod and customers in target regions as their testing ground). - The teams are seated in open bullpens and tasked with ever-changing-priority duties. There is such a lack of cohesion that any upfront strategy discussed with anybody varies by individual. - There is no scrum process beyond a quick bi-weekly summary of what you completed. - Without tests, there is no guarantee that a newly-released version set will even compile. Colleagues get the bad news upon pulling the new bundle into their environment and watching it burst into flames.  On calls.

Golden handcuffs: A big upfront sign on bonus paid in full that tapers off over time. Get hired, receive chunk of money, spend it, discover unpleasantries, be financially imprisoned or pay back bonus and depart.  For these reasons, Amazon has earned its reputation as a meat grinder. Developers must be able to deal with spending several days/weeks accomplishing a task that, anywhere else, would be completed in a few hours. Furthermore, the ecosystem is hacks on top of hacks.

Generally Amazon is incredibly political with layers of management and various warring factions within the layers. You can easily end up in some project that exists in contested ground leading to a situation in which your contribution will come under undue scrutiny from various actors. The management of the place seems to revel in this kind of culture, they seem to want it to be this way.

33011,amazon,2014,"'Recruitment' process, via an agency, was incredibly easy. Nice co-workers. The worst things about employment at this particular Amazon customer service facility isn't the job itself but the massive over-reliance on temporary agency workers, which pervades the entire management structure and has a huge impact on how you're assessed in your progress reviews. As a newbie CSA going through a week of mandatory shadowing, the mentoring advice is frequently conflicting (mentor one: you should contact the depot to track this order, mentor two (angrily): why the hell did you contact the depot for this?) and the poor and contradictory advice often has unfair repercussions on our performance statistics, which are sacrosanct at this job. Almost everyone, including our 'managers', mentors, etc, are temps (most of the facility), and permanency is spoken about in whispered tones as a lofty ideal which many aspire to but impossibly few seem to achieve. Oddly enough the few 'blue badges' at the facility (those on contract) often seem the most demotivated of the lot. The result is that the majority of the workforce live without much job security, motivation or critically the kind of in depth knowledge of the company and customer service procedures that you would expect from your seniors. The two weeks training new CSAs are put through initially feels like initiation into a cult with endless repetition of meaningless jargon and references to 'Jeff' (Bezos). You almost begin to buy how great Amazon is and how much it truly cares for its staff until the first person in the training class is called out for being five seconds late for break (EVERYTHING is monitored obsessively) and you realize that, yes, you're really expected to leave your desk, go through four swipe checkpoints, queue in the canteen, eat, and return, in the space of fifteen minutes. The job was exciting and challenging for about two days while fresh on the 'floor' but then became mind-numbingly boring with the same two or three issues being dealt with continuously. In addition to the overbearing monitoring from anonymous middle managers, the massive reliance on performance statistics, in which negative customer feedback is often unfairly left on the basis of the customer's experience at Amazon (rather than your performance at CSA) becomes a problem, and unpaid overtime soon becoming the norm (any contacts received before the end of your shift must be dealt with before you're allowed leave).

33016,amazon,2014,"Very strong brand name, Amazon continues to innovate and its exciting to be part of a business that continues to grow quickly, and to be reinvesting in the business and releasing new products. I can honestly say that I have worked with the smartest people in my career at Amazon, which encourages me to raise my game. Strong leadership principles that provide clarity on how to get things done in the business. A word of warning if you are a parent or have obligations away from the work place that you need/would like to also find time for. Amazon expects your full commitment- there are many reviews on here of people calling out appalling work/life balance- so pay heed to these. There have been so many instances I have seen of employees on sick leave through stress and anxiety, with little attention paid to why and to integrate these back into the business or provide the appropriate support. Amazon is a burn out mill that requires your full focus, so perfect for those who need validation in their lives from a work perspective, but awful for those who don't. Very frugal environment with extremely lean teams- pretty typical for most individuals to be doing 2 roles at once. Business continues to grow but is an increasing concern that any revenues achieved through growth don't seem to feed back to the employee.  Senior management attitude is to focus on things that go wrong- never any call outs for what has gone well. Depressing attitude to take in a business that demands so much from employees. Amazon gets data, doesn't get people or how to encourage a positive collegiate culture. Lots of new naive MBA's that the business can suck dry. Very high turnover of staff- people leave/disappear and are never heard of again.  The only people I would recommend Amazon to are those who are willing to completely throw themselves 100% into their career for a few years to get experience and the name on their CV- even then you need to be very careful about what you take on board- the business will suck the life out of you if you let it. Recognize that all employees are also customers. If the business is customer obsessed- it should also be employee obsessed.

There's no question that having Amazon on your CV is good for your career. Poor direction from senior management who couldn't decide what they wanted.  Bureaucracy. Oh, the bureaucracy.  Politics. Woe betide you if you worked in a group or on a project that senior management didn't find sexy.  Churn. Despite intensive recruiting, people left faster than they could be replaced. The hiring bar was rightly high, but there were too many ways to fail the interview for spurious and/or arbitrary reasons. The recruitment process may work better in Seattle where Amazon is one of the biggest names in town, but the competition for developers in London is too intense. There are other prestige tech giants, there are big media companies, there are startups, there are banks with deep pockets. In this environment, Amazon can't turn down good people and meet its hiring needs (and indeed, they had to import lots of staff from Seattle to keep the office afloat).  On-call. Being woken up in the middle of the night got very old after a while.  And finally, the kicker: work-life balance. The company pretty much destroyed a few of my colleagues. Amazon are very good at using guilt to get people to work all the hours God sends, for no particular reward. At the end of one spectacularly hellish project, everyone got -- a T-shirt. Not the best way to make your employees feel valued. Decide on your product road map *before* sending your development teams on death marches.  Admit that London is a different labour market to Seattle and act accordingly. It's hard to get things done when half your colleagues have left and there's nobody to take their place.

Please don't get overawed by the facilities they offer like AC cabs, beverages, food coupens, laptops, water bottles, goodies etc. These are certain things which your previous organizations might not have offered you. But there will come a stage where you will realize that these were offered to you so that you think great about the company and work really really hard and sincere forgetting your personal life completely. And if you don't have an understanding life partner he or she might even divorce you, for you will be glued to your laptop always. I worked for Amazon for a period 2 years on continuous rotational shifts. I was so happy to receive a laptop when I joined. Later I understood I am expected to login to it even after I return home from office. In those 2 years, I slogged for atleast 14 hours, 6 days a week and accomplished so much, which a normal person would have accomplished only in 4 or 5 years. You will become like a robot and will still be boasting on facebook and whatsapp about the cool things that Amazon offer you. But you will face the biggest shock of your life when out of no where you will be asked to sign a document called PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) and made to put down your papers. This happened not only to me but also 6 more people in my team. Your career life will be screwed up completely and so will be your personal life and health. Does Jeff Bezos have the guts to sign a PIP document himself ? If so many employees are put into PIP for non performance, is that not an indication that the organization is also non performing ? In that case, the CEO should also take up the PIP challenge. Let him take up the PIP challenge and prove himself first. My key takeaways from Amazon are only high diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Please note that I did not have even traces of these health issues before I joined Amazon.

Incredibly fast pace of growth means a large amount of varied and interesting projects to take responsibility in with equally driven people. However you'll be expected to juggle this alongside your day-to-day role with no impact on your category deliverables, hence the need to be able to absolutely dedicate yourself to the job if you want to get anywhere and not have a breakdown. You will give up plenty of evenings and weekends if you intend to be there for a few years.  Promotion can be achieved but you need to be political - identify tools or fixes that will improve most categories, figure out a scalable way to deliver them and start shouting about them. Peer reviews and cross-category influence are key to progression whatever level you're at. True of every company to an extent, but you'll quickly see how Amazon takes that and everything else to the nth degree. The demanding environment combined with the relative rarity of promotions means that many level 6 and 7 managers are hired from outside the company rather than being promoted from within. The effect of this limits continuity planning and actually attracts some very average managers, because Amazon isn't like most workplaces.

Either way, your voice is never heard.  Failure to deliver on promises.

You'd be faulted for not ""Having Backbone"" if you said yes to take on an additional job role, yet you'd also be faulted for not having ""Ownership"" and not thinking of the entire company if you said no. Most of the senior management do not ""Dive Deep"" and roll up their sleeves. When they do, it'd be a big thing and you'd see emails being sent all over the place.  Vested shares.

No teamwork, no camaraderie. I remember one of the senior management once mentioning he doesn't believe in friends within the workplace because it leads to employees not wanting to perform and outdo one another.

Worst of all- Couple of India centric teams in Bangalore run the company as if it's their family business. Not that they care for the product so much but they tend to hire misfit 'Family members' into the team and place them at senior positions , which is often demotivating and unethical.

33169,amazon,2014,"Good salary. Other than that I dont see much of pros in the company. Amazon is big on its culture. It has set of Leadership principles that every employee is asked to follow  and measured against during performance review. Amazon stresses on taking data driven decisions. Engineers are given more value than their Managers, because companies strength is its engineers. Performance is based on 360 degrees feedback where engineers give skip level feedback about their managers.  Although above three principles are great, the problem comes in applying these leadership principles and priorities in Indian culture where engineers are not matured, professional or honest compared to US.  Here are the few issues that I have observed.  1. Engineers are mostly fresh out of college, don't have any maturity. But they are given power  to judge whether their manager is good or not.  2. There is a lot of bias and favoritism. Agarwals, Guptas, people from Delihi dominate the company.  3. Yearly reviews are a circus. They make their decision first and then use data to either to ding you or promote you. They make the decision based on other reasons and then make up the data to support it.  4. Quality of work is not great either. Everything is automated. Most of the juicy work is done in Seattle. Your work mostly involves using the tools and frameworks developed in Seattle. Work involves mostly modifying UI widgets and some minor changes in existing services. Nothing to be really proud of.  5. Lots of overhead for managers. You need to spend most of your time ""pampering' engineers.  6. If you rate some one in your team as a low performer, team can gang up against you and give you bad rating in 360 review.

Progression and development depends on who you know, not what skills, attributes and strengths you have. If you speak out you become a social outcast and ostracised from the daily workings of the company, despite having the backbone to do this is one of the company’s core principles. Infrastructure is outdated and despite being one of the fastest growing companies turning over billions of dollars of profit every year, most projects and developments are deployed on a shoestring. IT is prehistoric and needs updating, culture and discipline is in general draconic and abused. Associate morale is little more than a pipe dream and it seems the unhappier you are, the less they will seek to resolve it. So if you want to work excessively long hours, for little or no reward, feel unappreciated, unvalued and be little more than a number……….step right up for a slice of Amazon life!!! Listen to your colleagues, uphold the company values and ethos and accept the feedback passed on. This is the most effective way to improve, progress and expand. Deal with the Senior Managers who have little to do with their time than inflate their overly exaggerated egos and pursue their own agendas. Work/Life balance means there should be a balance on both sides - hence the use of the word balance. The workforce you have deserve time with their families and friends and the freedom to feel they are not being punished for requesting this. Learn from the blogs and forums you create, when a customer says they are not happy, try to understand why and develop methods of preventing this in the future........compensation should always be your last resort.  Above all else, sort out the low morale and work with the talent and skills you employed people for in the first place. If this means getting rid of a few selfish Senior Managers who have little time for development of the business and it's associates, so be it!!",-14.857572,1.6066235,-0.06414471903441507,0.008153892537552995,1.0,0.08104334077380952,0.5010595238095239

33263,amazon,2014,"1. Wages are higher than the market average, 2. Having Amazon on a CV adds a significant prestige to a candidate. 1. Worse environment ever: a hyper-competitive and grey flock that brainlessly executes against Jeff's strategy.  2. Self-centered sectarian culture. Jeff is viewed like an idol, a holier version of Jesus Christ that cannot be questioned on any of his actions/decision. He gave his population with 10 commandments (see Amazon Values): he punishes and rewards according to those. The only option here is not to show any brain / self analytical ability: every deviation from the commandments is a true tabu for the Holy Inquisition. Competitors are hated with rancor, top management is adored, employees are hammered every day with the holy scriptures of the week (Jeff letter to investors, Jeff's last interview, Jeff vision on how to grow strawberries).  3. Un-human work-life balance. Actually internally they say you should talk about work-life ""harmony"": a totally different concept than ""balance"". One of the many trials to make you accept you'll have to spend most of your weekends in the office, not to speak about your evenings and sometime nights. All for what? They'd say ""We are making history"", another of Jeff's brilliant truths. Of course, you don't make history working 8 hrs per day. Not a surprise the average life of an employee is 12 months with the company. Once at a summit an employee was publicly honored because he preferred to come to the office rather than going to his sick child at the hospital. Before accepting an offer by Amazon, please consider that this is what they reword. 1. To get awareness that they do not make history, they run a squalid supermarket. Making history would be ending the Palestinian conflict, looking after cancer, adopting a child. Not shipping in less hours.  2. Improve employees Work-Life balance: even if you can make a person work 24 hrs a week 365 days a year, people do run away from the company. Net net, you'd gain in efficiency by having employees staying with the company a little longer.  3. Guys, you should take it easy: life is short and no exception will be made for you because you'll lower Laptop prices of 1 cent.

33271,amazon,2014,"Check out other reviews to find something good about Amazon or AWS. I hardly have any that is not stated in other reviews. Amazon is proud of being data driven and that is fine when the data is chosen correctly and applied wisely. Here are some examples of applying it wrongly, but still sticking to the point of ""I am driven by data"" crap.  A manager I worked for tracked individual story points delivered by members in sprints and used those points to compare and push developers for delivering more. It doesn't matter whether you were oncall during one of those 2 weeks sprints(and didn't work on sprint stories) or the other person worked 18 hours a day - you have to be on par. If you try to explain that is not how sprints should be treated and it is all about team effort - he would brand you as having incomplete understanding of scrum!  Another manager in Dublin uses the number of code commits/reviews you sent out to measure your delivery effectiveness. A code change or configuration change that takes 2 minutes is counted the same as a code change you would be working on for 4 days in introducing a new feature. I wish he had the backbone to publish his data driven logic of counting code commits to measure developer effectiveness to the wider developer community within the company and seek feedback.  All those measurements are done secretly by the way. There is no upfront notice of ""this is what I am tracking to measure developer's delivery effectiveness"" heads up. If you believe you are right about your data driven ""developer effectiveness measure"", why are you coy about it? As managers you oversee the projects executed by your team. You change priorities and reallocate resources. But acknowledge that such activities will delay the delivery of the other projects where from you pulled out resources.  Don't again madly stick to the old dates and pass the blame to the project executors - what you call as tech leads. You pulled out the resources and as a reasonable person, own the responsibility for the delay. Don't blame the executors for not coming up with 'creative ideas' to deliver it on time despite you changing priorities and taking away resources.",-12.551898,-3.4826171,-0.09609495167052527,0.04953210279560228,1.0,0.07786208356860531,0.5981272350837569

34452,facebook,2014,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true, it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc.  This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.  It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.  One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.  They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.  The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.  Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.  You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.  FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.  Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.  The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it. FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.  FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.  FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent. You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow. I think this could be really tough.",3.2885551,-4.5293226,0.008103134190308147,0.04795184578751881,5.0,0.22108382936507928,0.5007113095238093

Facebook has a few things that set it apart:  1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.  2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams.  I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here.  The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever. With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore.  Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch).  Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me. I'm giving it a 5 because I think it's good for your life, not because I agree with that balance. I wish the PR team was more proactive rather than reactive. I understand how press cycles work, but Facebook does try to do the right thing and constantly gets skewered. I think shaking this team up a bit would help.",8.561583,-8.367218,0.006455113371059598,0.07615874416719164,5.0,0.1863431013431013,0.49108669108669106

35174,facebook,2014,"You ship code within your first two weeks. Hundreds of millions of people around the world care about what you do. Pay and benefits are great, particularly RSU offerings.

There aren't a lot of rules, other than security/privacy practices. Even on mobile apps, your code ships fast.  Facebook's onboarding process is the best I've ever seen, and I've worked at a lot of other major companies. You're hired as an engineer, not as someone to fill a specific job. Then you spend your first six weeks getting to know how all of the company works, filling in small holes on code bases that you aren't familiar with (web, Android, iOS, data analysis stuff), and learning what problems in the company you most want to work on, before you pick your team. Every large software company should be doing this. They do claim ownership of code you write outside of work, unless you run it by legal first. Don't ever get rid of Boot Camp. Adding on iOS and Android camp afterwards is a great idea, I wish it had been there when I started.  Please change the ""we own all you do, even outside of work, unless you clear it first"" policy. It might turn Silicon Valley die-hards off, particularly the startup dreamers who want to get their feet wet first at a company known for moving fast. I think we'd want to snag those people and convince them to pursue their ideas with us, rather than frighten them away with the thought that they might legally give away their big idea when they come to it.

35175,facebook,2014,"The people are smart, and the scaling challenges are great. Where else does your code impact a billion people? The compensation is amazing.  Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate. The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.  Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.  After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.  Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site.

The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.  I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined.  In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years. I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path. Plus, people who are hired are usually senior, so I feel there is less of a need for a strict career plan. When you work at Netflix, you are exposed to so much that it is easy to explain why you grow so much in a short period of time.

Lots of blame game behavior played as subtly (yet transparently if you pay attention) as possible. Some managers spend too much time in the code instead of managing their team. I had the experience of offering many recommendations for improving team performance and not having them implemented because the culture here is to just do what you want and either get rewarded hugely or sacked. Management coaching appears to be improving, but inconsistently applied. I've seen people who need to be let go stay on for a long time with many opportunities to change and people who were very competent let go without much warning that they need to change something. I've also seen projects executed that solved the business problems presented but were dropped because management didn't like it rather than some other specific reasons. Management is not about process, I think Netflix has that correct. Excellent management is about getting problems out of the way of employees so that they can excel and about managing interpersonal conflicts so that a team can leverage one another's strengths to push the team higher than before.

As so many leadership books say, you can tell way more about someone by what they say NO to, and how well they can say NO. Netflix doesn't do ads, pay-per-view, purchasable content, or porn. Just thoughtful, edgy, and family programming so you can enjoy your subscription. They're bigger than people perceive, around 3,000 at time of this writing, but still have that startup feel of ""just get stuff done."" They get rid of all unnecessary process, so even in management, I can spend most of my time focusing on adding value to our customers instead of administrivia. Netflix prides themselves on hiring super senior people that are like a pro team. Everyone is treated like a professional. You won't find any interns at Netflix. You'll only be working with people that have been in the industry and are smart at what they're doing--but that doesn't mean they're smart at everything.

41613,apple,2014,"- Great benefits - great work environment - great salary (especially for retail) - lots of peer support - lots of management support - lots of learning experiences and resources - opportunity for advancement - opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!) - you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family! - Amazing sense of belonging and community - great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice - Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers). - FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes. - Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing. - Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis. - No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't) you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess. - ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues. - Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow. My feedback section was long, I realize, but it's because I genuinely care about Apple as a company and would love to see things improve in real, tangible ways where the signal to noise ratio is considered for retail as much as it is considered for its products and services!  Consider and analyze the cons I wrote above and communicate them with your market leaders! How successful IS Pathways, really, for example? Everything has to be given a chance to work, of course, but I think maybe corporate doesn't get enough constructive feedback from its retail stores for fear of being perceived as not having put enough effort into making these things work.  Regardless, I loved working for Apple and would absolutely return given the need and/or opportunity.",2.7341864,-4.426294,-0.014145635430778295,0.04049796114198884,5.0,0.20969561688311686,0.5095042388167388
43594,apple,2014,"I got to work with some of the smartest people in the world on really tough problems, and got to really contribute, my work shipped in an identifiable way - which in such a large company was an amazing thing. The energy of working at Apple was addictive, not to mention the fact that everyone (family, friends) were in awe of you working there.  I briefly worked at Google after leaving Apple, and my god, it was a stark difference. At Apple everyone focused on product, everyone knew that what they did made a difference and poured their hearts and souls into every day there. At google... not so much. Projects were cancelled regularly and people just didn't care, whether your product shipped or not, Google still got paid from advertising, so hey - why bother sweating it? There was a LOT of work, but I was absolutely happy to do it. Brainwashing? Not really, more just making the most of the opportunity in front of me. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.  When I started, it was very management light. We got to move incredibly fast and make decisions mostly ourselves. By the time I left there were layers upon layers of program managers and the hiring bar was noticeably lower. That tends to spoil things for everyone.  New projects at apple feel like startups with unlimited resources and no investors to pander to... ie, spectacular... but after a few years of success, the structure calcifies and though it's still a good job, it's not the same rush. Compensation (RSUs etc) was great at the start, but kept going down every year whilst the company made more and more money, this just felt wrong when you were working 70+ hours a week.  You really need a super-clueful CTO who isn't involved in the politics - someone who can cut through the crap and ensure your VPs aren't outmaneuvering you. You effectively had one, but sadly he is no longer with us.",9.162734,-8.587409,0.02385651905195778,0.07289589560768378,5.0,0.17665308547661485,0.5144292798704564
43599,apple,2014,"Many of my friends from college work at Google and Facebook, and from my conversations I can honestly say that Apple values design more than any other tech company. Don't get me wrong, Google and Facebook (as well as a few other notable Silicon Valley corporations) have extremely high standards when it comes to design and user experience, but Apple takes it to a whole new level. They treat designers like royalty, and it shows in the products. As a software designer, I do feel highly valued at Apple. I do feel that I am doing great work. I do feel that I am more of an artist, a craftsman, than a developer. And I do feel that the long working hours pay off, not in cash but in the ability to look at the work I've done with my team and think to myself that this is what Picasso would use today. That's priceless. The 'climbing a ladder for prestigious positions' doesn't exist here because that's not what Apple stands for. The workers are here to design beautiful products together, and if everyone competes for meaningless position titles, the product quality worsens. That's why Apple doesn't really give a lot of freedom to move up. Working at Google and Facebook and Twitter is probably better financially, and it probably delivers a lot less stress. That's excellent if you plan on having a family and spending time with your kids. I do have trouble managing time because I usually work overtime four to five times a week. Of course, this gets frustrating, but I love what I do, and so the extra work is never a reason to quit or complain. Secrecy is also a pain, as some of us even carry a wallet with half a dozen security badges. We are told multiple times a day that our work can never be discussed outside certain rooms, and in some cases we don't even know what were working on. For example, I had a project for a product that I had no idea about. I assumed it was a new version of iPad, but it ended up being for the brand new iPad mini. And I knew it was for the iPad mini on the same day the world was introduced to iPad mini. Yeah, that level of secrecy can really get annoying. But it also keeps things interesting ... There are a lot of unintellectual brats running divisions they shouldn't be running. This was always there, but severely worsened after Steve Jobs left. That's not entirely Tim Cooks fault, it's mainly the fault of the recruiting division. Getting the Burberry CEO is genius, but getting snobby programmers from San Jose State to run important divisions is simply stupid. Lucky, I don't deal with them to often. And in many cases, they are cool. But the stress that they have is often pushed to workers, and that's something that Apple really needs to fix.",1.2429364,-7.887168,-0.009345300685296511,0.06810218338771544,5.0,0.14808602744772958,0.49180989223542393

I think the compensation was very fair compared to other companies, and those people who really are rock stars really get very well compensated. The culture (in engineering) is a tough one, hard on people who aren't at the top of their game. I think that Apple actually is a pretty high integrity place in general, but in my experience there certainly used to be a very strong political nature. This is always true in any organization with a lot of people, of course, but at Apple there was a certain sloppiness about allowing bad managers without a strategic plan to continue to survive and do damage far too long just because they were good at making their bosses feel good. Maybe this was just the case in the group where I worked. Maybe this has changed since Tim Cook has taken over. Find more ways to actually measure the quality of the managers. Do more evaluation of the value and worth of the managers as seen by the people reporting to them. This is for two reasons 1) It helps upper levels recognize managers who are hated by their people 2) It helps upper levels recognize managers who are adored by their people. There have been cases where managers were fired even though their people thought they were great, and the groups then fall apart completely. There have been cases where the managers were completely hideous but were great at managing up, so their people were tortured for ages.

I worked in IS&T group at apple. This IS&T is totally different from the main Apple. I have often heard this: ""Those who don't make it into the infinite loop, end up at IS&T"". In other words, IS&T is a second rate citizen at apple. Of course, IS&T supports many IT services (jobs, recruiting, payrolll, mail, directory, sales, GBI). For instance, online and retail stores are supported by IS&T.  2. You see 3 contractors for every employee in IS&T. And IS&T has global contracts with Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc, the latter companies supply 1 online resource for every 4 offshore resources. In many application support groups, you find the dumbest of the dumb among the people that global offshoring companies have placed.  3. Too much politics and too many lifers in IS&T. The only game in the town for IS&T is to how to brown nose each other. Yes, there are too many Indians there, as a consequence, you find smart people among them, and dumbos as well.  4. Advice to prospective employees: if you are talented, and if you can find a better job, just avoid any and every group in IS&T. Someone may say ""Oh, apple gonan help you on your resume"", it is half true. If you are smart, talented, you don't to worry about the apple factor on resume.  If you get a job in the core engineering groups, go for it. If you are interviewing in IS&T, just avoid any offer and go and work elsewhere, and increae your skills.  5. If you are applying for some project manager, manager, teamleads (for app support, etc), of course, you won't have much choice. I don't complain if you go for IS&T: but it is a great place to learn politicking. This politicking has led to more offshoring, why? The more employees you get, the more you need to fight for bonus for your group, so, it is better to offshore, and keep less number of employees, and get more bonus.  6. You are not going to get any quarterly bonus, however, people in core groups get such bonuses. Some people don't get first year bonus in IS&T. And the bonus is like 7 to 10 percent.

It's easy to request days off, and there's good vacation and holiday pay.  The work itself is relatively straight forward and easy, everything is streamlined and follows a scope of service.  The coworkers are the best part of any store, they are the best people around. Friendships for life are often formed.  Employees don't earn commission, so it reduces the pressure to have perform.  It's possible to transfer to other stores in the US and possibly the world, so there's flexibility for people who want to move.  Management is very caring and attentive. It's retail. That means retail hours (no weekends off, random work schedules every week, no consistency, no set days off).  No sick time for part timers.  The stores often feel under staffed. The staff complains a lot about feeling overwhelmed when it's busy. Dealing with ebbs and flows is always an issue in the retail environment. It would be nice to invest the downtime back into the people's training rather than run a lean staff.  Little to no training time during launches and holidays.  There's no direct route to Corporate, as people might expect. The two are worlds apart, and work in the stores may not appropriately prepare someone for work in the Corporate level (or other jobs, for that matter, other than tech support).  Management doesn't have a lot of leeway in terms of innovating processes. Because of brand consistency, it takes a long time for changes to happen across all stores. Give employees at least one set day off per week, one of those days being a weekend. Hire weekend staff or offer overtime for people to work weekends. I know it's standard to expect retail workers to work weekends and holidays, but wouldn't it be nice for a company that prides itself on innovation (and calls these jobs ""careers"") to innovate what a career in retail could be with a little more care.

I don't have to worry about commuting and I can wake up 10 minutes before the start of my shift and start work on time. I also found that I was able to eat better as I did not have to pack a lunch or go out to a restaurant.  I think the pay and benefits are pretty good for this line of work, you get overtime and holiday pay. You also get a decent amount of vacation and sick time.  There is some room for advancement and some control over schedule, but more on that below.  I personally find a lot of satisfaction in helping others and this job offers plenty of opportunity to do so. After finishing work most days I feel like I made a positive difference in the world, however some company policies stifle this (more below). As a Tier 2 or Senior Advisor you have a lot of empowerment to help others, much more than a Tier 1 advisor. When on calls I am constantly stressed about my performance metrics such as call handle time, survey results, and conforming to Apple's call flow guidelines. It is upsetting to receive a bad survey over an issue that you did not cause or have no control over, especially when you did everything possible to correct the problem.  The surveys and other other performance metrics are used to decide priority when bidding for schedules. One or two bad surveys can be the difference between working a good schedule or a bad schedule. To me, it is the difference between having time to spend with friends and family or barely seeing them at all. I have worked extremely hard to achieve good metrics and I am typically in the top 10-20% in the internal advisor rankings, yet this is still not enough to get both weekend days off.  Advancement is also a problem. I was able to move up to Tier 2 fairly quickly, but beyond this, it is much more challenging. There are a limited number of positions available beyond Tier 2 and there is such a vast amount of talent you are competing with for those spots. So far, in almost 2 years on my team of 18 people, only 1 person has advanced to a higher position. Admittedly, if you work ""on-site"" you have more opportunities available.  Another big frustration for me is that it as advisors, we have a surprising lack of tools to do our job. I would think that as one of the largest software and hardware manufacturers, we would have a range of diagnostics, tests, and utilities at our disposal to correct and handle issues that arise with customer's devices, but this is not the case. We have access to an internal knowledge base (90% of which is already publicly accessible on our support site), the ability to run very basic diagnostics on iOS devices, and access to some account information - that is all. We are also not given much information in regards to any ""known issues"" or bugs in the software. In short, as advisors we put in a position where we are fairly ignorant and blind, which often makes us look bad and doesn't do any favors for the company. Basically, we just have to make the best of what we have and use experience and logic to solve problems.  Perhaps I just had higher expectations that Apple would be a more progressive and resourceful company, but I think it suffers from most of the problems facing large organizations in that change is difficult and slow. There is a huge amount of talent in the At-Home Advisor space and I feel that can be leveraged to address issues in a better way. Our organization is set up to be very reactionary and I would like to see more of a proactive approach to issues. Maybe allowing advisors more time to work very extensively with engineering on issues that are call drivers so that the problem can be addressed in future updates. Currently, we are very pressured to address a large quantity of calls, whereas, I would like to see more quality calls that actually render solutions so customers never have to call in the first place.",-4.114851,-1.4758704,-0.029710383668117,0.033406486757224796,3.0,0.16242958687403128,0.5284785687563465

I worked for Apple, then left to pursue another career. A couple years ago I ended up in a city where it was difficult to pursue my occupation so I went to the Apple Store to interview for a position as a ""Genius."" I was so shocked at what its become-- or how I've changed, I'm not sure which.  Its like everyone snorts Zoloft. I appreciate being positive, but this was positive taken to the nth degree, a scary, conforming kind of positive. It's like everyone was looking around to make sure they were smiling at least 10% more than the others: and their eyes spoke fear. I like Apple overall, but Steve was a tyrant and the company greenlit some absolute steamers, against the advice of people who knew what they were talking about. Rather than admit they screwed up, though, the company religion is that Apple can do no wrong and you (the consumer, or the doubter) are the problem. As in, it was ""just too advanced for you"", or ""you just don't get it.""  I agree with another reviewer on the willing isolation and ignorance. Apple's OS X really was a thing of beauty when it was first rolled out… more than a decade ago. A decade. TEN YEARS. Ever since, we've been hopping along on forced upgrades that look more and more candy while sucking up more and more memory. Meanwhile, the Calendar app blows, iTunes blows, and Apple's push to exclude Microsoft Office from its mobile suite (in favor of everybody's favorite, ""Pages"") just annoys everybody who has to do something serious. Where's the innovation that changes someone's life?  Gone, because now Apple's cool. It's the popular kid, wearing the polos and the cardigans.

They're really great as favors for friends/family who have jobs that pay more than yours. - Management is extremely skilled at giving you the runaround (also known as Feedback) when it comes time for promotion or a lateral shift in positions. Interviews either end up going cold with no response, or some ""surprise star candidate"" will swoop out of nowhere to take the position you desire so dearly. - Glass ceiling. Extremely little room for advancement. Someone has to either die or get fired for a spot to open up. There are pretty much 2-3 positions you can move into before ""management' is the next step, where you get a nice little raise to get yelled at by more customers and deal with disgruntled employees who have no future. - Resume killer. Once you've spent enough time in retail, you're essentially silo-ing yourself into that industry. Recruiters will see your experience as retail and generalize you as a retail salesperson, despite your own perception that you do not work at Macy's, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, etc. If retail is your career choice, you're in the right place. If it isn't, you're screwing yourself. - Methodologies to provide customers with ""options"" for service are really just an euphemism for coercing the customer to conform to the workflow that Apple has set out. You are taught to repeat the same ""option"" repeatedly until the customer gives up, and agrees with you. That is NOT successful negotiation. It's not truly a choice if you can only provide the option to take it or leave it. That is called communism/socialism/totalitarianism. (ps. This is America.) - False perception of creativity. Apple positions itself as a company that breeds creativity. Truth be told, the retail store is merely a delivery mechanism for distributing products. As an employee, you have no impact on product development, processes, etc. You are merely a drone whose role is to hand customers product with a smile and collect payment. (The finger doesn't tell the brain what to do. The finger does what it's supposed to do.) - Fight for your employees. Protect their personal lives, their time, and their dignity. - If you are not interested in hiring or promoting the person, don't yank their chain and give them an interview. It creates false expectations, the very thing you seek to avoid with customers. Hope is a very powerful thing. Stop abusing it. - Understand the needs of your employees. Do the same as you would with a customer. - Provide employees the bandwidth to make decisions. Canned responses and rigid policy help to standardize the level of service, AT THE MINIMUM.

43937,apple,2014,"In the two positions I've held at Apple, I've been able to work from home for both. Not commuting is nice, but many times, this may not feel like a ""pro."" Employee discount is better than I expected. Ample vacation days (12 for entry level first-time job) and pretty lenient with sick leave. It's nice to not really have a script that I'm required to read from, since basically AppleCare, as well as my previous Online Store Chat position, closely resembled stereotypical call-center jobs. As a home-based employee, of course my interactions with co-workers and supervisors were expected to be drastically different than they would be in a real office. But there's never an effort to balance this out. I can go weeks without a word of casual conversation being said in the team chatroom. I feel almost embarrassed that I'm holding a bachelor's degree from a top university, but I'm surrounded by dull people who do nothing all day but play video games and sleep. You cycle through managers and teams, shift schedules, even entire job roles wlly-nilly, without any input on your part.  There is really no interest in the satisfaction of the customer. It's all about the metrics. You can have stellar reviews from customers, and documented peer feedback from other departments bragging about you, but if you can't average out a 15 minute phone call time to fix the endless list possible issues that can go wrong with a computer, then you're in the hot seat. Don't ""fix"" your behaviors in 3, 6, then 7 months and you're probably going to be canned. So it's either be curt, and frankly rude, to a lot of the people that buy products from you, or fall down the totem pole in the staff rank and get stuck working a late night shift the next time shift bids come around, which will make good performance tougher, your personal life lonelier, all while any recommendation for a change in the operating procedures is balked at by management.  One is expected to clock-in and immediately start taking calls. 60 seconds is expected between hanging up one call, finishing the case notes, and taking your next call. Any time over 5 minutes will have you speaking with a supervisor. I once had my pay revoked for taking 20 minutes to check email and get situated before logging into the call queue. And even if you're not completely hoarse and exhausted from a nonstop cycle of calls, you will be pressured, and by that i mean threatened with zero consideration for future upward movement, if you do not partake in at least 6 hours per week of overtime during the busy season, which is about 5 months out of the year. I stopped caring when I realized I was spending my extra money from OT on prescription painkillers for my back from being chained to a desk every solitary second for 7.5 hours (that's a day minus 1 hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks). Also during this busy season, you will experience cancellation of team meetings, training seminars, or any other offline time that might have given you a moment of rest from the endless work or time to work on a side project that you could use to show your skills to other areas of the company.  Sum of the story: you are paid to do exactly one job and one job only and you're not allowed to do or think anything else besides that one job. It's a dead-end. I hear the salaried positions are pretty cool, but if you have to work like a dog at the entry level, I hate to think of how life-consuming a position with actual responsibility at this company must be. Hire more people, people should be allowed to take a breather from such a robotic job, but we can't because we're severely understaffed. Respect talented, intelligent employees with actual competence. Stop promoting based on whether you can reach an arbitrary metric. Being able to blast through a call and being callous with customers does not equal good management material. If I had known I would be forced into such a short-sighted job, where the there's no time to actually appreciate and consider that some individuals might just be really good at doing other jobs besides just this one thing, I would have gone to work for a bank or something.",0.8703597,-20.25758,-0.01704958837025984,0.08886416538682078,1.0,0.029296186067019385,0.5030120149911819

Also, pretty strong discounts on third party products from time to time. (like 40% off Bose, etc.) Also, additional $500 off after the 25% off Mac once every three years. So you can basically get an $1800 Mac for $850 once every three years. -Tuition Reimbursement (which may be getting enhanced to cover PT employees as well as FT) -Good hourly wage (plus overtime) in a retail environment. New PT Specialists start at around $14 per hour, and you can be making $17-19 after 3-4 years if you get promoted to an Expert (sales leader) , or get promoted to Genius (technician) or Creative (Trainer). Usually get about a 4% raise every year. But that depends on how you do. And if you can cut through the red tape to get there. -The only metrics they look at are AppleCare attach rate, One to One attach rate, and accessories sold...and they really don't ever have a conversation with you if you're doing poorly (or well, for that matter) -It's a pretty ""cushy"" job. Products sell themselves. Just come to work, do your job, and you'll be fine. It's busy. Really busy sometimes. Expect to stand on your feet all day, all shift. And the floors are mostly hard concrete/rock. You are required to work two days out of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and one additional day. As a FT employee, I had both of my days off during the week, and worked pretty much every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Each store may be a little different, though, so ask if you are concerned. Promotions are difficult. Hard to get to where you want to go, and definitely no clear path to management. Lots of politics and grudges held. When I left, I was still being reminded of mistakes I had made 3 years ago. Also, Leadership can tend to micromanage. I suspect that this is different in each store. Some customers are tough customers who have overly high expectations. The hours are lousy, especially during the holidays. Sometimes you might work 3pm-12am, even though the mall closes at 10pm. Expect 5x 9 hr. shifts during your week, with one hour unpaid lunch each shift and two paid 15 minute breaks each shift. But don't expect to go to lunch on time, or to take your 15 minute breaks on time, because you probably won't. Apple is in some hot water for this out in California. You aren't paid commission, bonus, or anything, just hourly, so no matter how well you outperform everyone else, you get the same pay. I never heard of anyone, save for maybe three people out of 170, not get the standard 4% raise. Do not play games with our livelihoods. Be upfront and honest about where we are, and what the opportunities are and how to get there. Actually help us to get there. I understand that the ""journey is the reward"" but it seems strange to me that I would be a top 10 sales person at the store I worked at and not be recognized monetarily.  Pay attention to who is doing well and who isn't doing well, and reward those that are doing well.  Also, stop sending us cheap hooded sweatshirts at Christmas time as a ""bonus"".

It is a part time job and won't deliver quite what I'd be looking for in the future (with more flexibility and better pay). The managers can be micromanaging and I know that sounds like I'm not trying to work. I'm honestly good at what I do and am rated very high by my customers and am in the top 5 in all categories for part timers. Yet they still are challenging and not trusting me to do what is right for the customer. I haven't done anything to warrant that and honestly have been a good employee - delivering great sales and support. There are just a few managers that shouldn't and that can really make work exhausting when you don't trust the leadership. It should be easier to get promoted within the company. Majority of the mangers within the company are external hires which makes it really discouraging to allow for people to move up. Also a gross difference in pay and the fact that mangers get bonuses if we hit certain revenue levels bothers me.

44050,apple,2014,"I've seen some bad reviews on Glassdoor about working at IS&T at Apple, and I feel compelled to share my experience there because I think it was actually pretty great. Some aspects of corporate culture that I see shared by most (if not all) areas in apple:    1) A standard of excellence, which can be extremely satisfying for perfectionists. At other companies that I have worked, there tends to be a mentality that as soon as something is 'good enough' it is pushed into QA or production. At Apple, things don't move forward until they are excellent.    2) Passion for work. I've never been at a large company where employees are genuinely this passionate about their work. You won't encounter any of the apathy that you often find in large corporations.    3) Cool problems. Numbers 1) and 2) are arguably made possible on a widespread level within the company because the problems that engineers are working to solve can be extremely interesting. Additionally, solutions almost always have a large footprint of impact due to the number of people who interact with Apple products on a day-to-day basis. You won't find yourself doing anything remedial.  So now the question becomes- how are things different in IS&T from other parts of the company? The answer is that it doesn't really. If anything, the impact of what you are working on is larger than in some other areas because a lot of what IS&T does is the foundation that makes consumer facing products possible to run on. There are entire companies out there that *only* make a one of the products that a given team in IS&T produces, and there is a good chance that IS&T is doing a better job of it. While all the teams in IS&T are different, I think that these general principles are true for all of them. One of the things that I found challenging was the modularity of the teams. By that, I mean that the teams in IS&T don't interact much with other teams except for when they have to for business reasons. Socially speaking, I don't see a lot of full time employees eating lunch with people from other teams that often. Also, within my own team I never really felt like I had a strong social connection to the people I worked with- people were often just coming in and doing their own work without really interacting that much with other people in the cubes around them. This means that in order to make work friends you kind of have to go out of your way to initiate contact with other people, which can make the first couple months of work a little tougher. This was my experience and I have also heard it echoed by other people in IS&T. none",3.3525195,2.0897317,0.007833718812788475,0.02072916877459796,4.0,0.16920485175202155,0.5394317160826594

Apple has thousands of employees getting things done, and no Windows, no Powerpoint, nowhere. Mac Book Pro with extra 27"" Thunderbolt Display is standard issue.

Work-life balance can be challenging at times, but I don't think it is any worse than most other Silicon Valley tech companies. You can't work at a Tier 1 Silicon Valley tech company and expect 9-5 / M-F. What I don't like: Food is not free like Google, and not as good as Google. However they give engineers a $12/day dinner voucher. That is enough at the slightly-subsidized cafeterias to purchase enough for dinner and the next day's lunch, so it's almost like free food. But the variety of food is not that great. Always seems to be the same stuff.

They tell you that you're there to connect with people, not just sell stuff or fix stuff, and I thought that it was just a lot of motivational fluff. It turned out that they were telling the absolute truth, at least in the beginning. Management was very supportive of me during some hard times, and that was something that, for the most part, remained constant. The only cons were during my last several months with the company. Certain managers left, and the senior managers that remained didn't really belong in a company whose credo starts with ""Our most important resource, our soul, is our people."" It started becoming a very ""transactional"" environment, where statistics and metrics became more important than what we were doing or accomplishing. People were promoted that didn't deserve a promotion, while people that did were given nonsensical reasons for being passed over. It became quickly apparent that leadership already knew who they wanted before the interviews began, so there was little reason to even try unless you were one of the ""chosen."" It makes it impossible to progress in the company unless you're willing to drink the kool-aid to the degree that you alienate your peers because you take on the bad leadership traits of existing management. First of all, stop cherry-picking the people you promote. Stop denying people the chance to even interview for promotions because of whatever reason you can think of in the moment. You're alienating people that could turn into your shining stars, and that's why you have so many people leaving. Treat your employees with dignity, as they're far more talented at running the show than you give them credit for. Stop resorting to guilt-trips and condescension to force agreement. Listen to criticisms and concerns with open minds, rather than rejecting everything that's brought to you because you want to save face. Hint: You make yourself look worse, not better.

I had a baby and I only paid $20, total. I had another surgery which cost $35000 and it only cost me $30, total. The pay for the amount of work is not good. Read below. The pay is less than normal for all the goals we have to complete. We have to make sure we sell the AppleCare Protection Plan to at least 3 customers out of 100, must maintain customer satisfaction goal of 80% (hard to do if customer gives a bad review for something you can't control).  For instance, if a customer calls in since their brand new computer is broken and you refer to the store to get it fixed, they can give you a negative survey which in turns makes your stats come down. Now management wants you to explain why they didn't approve of your service, etc., even though the calls are recorded.  They implemented a new call strategy called H2H. It entails me asking the customer permission to ask them questions (why do I have to ask them for permission if they are calling for help?), empathize with the customer (never enough empathy on your weekly reviews per manager), determine the customer's state of mind and talk to them dependant upon their personality. I must align myself with the customer (never do it since I have no idea what I am actually doing), assure the customer their issue will be resolved and make sure to clarify their resolution.  You have to make sure you solve at least 70% of customer issues (hard to do when the computer needs physical work done at the store), maintain a customer satisfaction goal of 80% (also hard to do when you get bad surveys because a customer was out of warranty and didn't want to pay for support $19), you also must make sure your calls are around 14.5 minutes long (too short, you're in trouble, too long, you're in trouble).  Dont expect to have a life. Mandatory OT for Christmas and other holidays. Also when there is a new product release. Good luck having a vacation during holiday time.  While on the phone you get a call around every 8 seconds so it's hard to take a breather. You must type notes while talking to the customer so you can make sure to take another call. If you don't hustle between calls you know what happens, another chewing out by your manager.  To top it all off you have 3 exams to take that you must pass or get fired. It's 8 hours a day training for 4 weeks. If you miss a day of training for any reason, you are fired. You do 4 hours a day of instructor led training and 4 hours just reading your own materials. If you don't read you won't pass and you will get fired. 5 people from my team didn't make it.  Lastly, don't expect to advance quickly. Most managers are promoted at an average around 4 years. The bad thing is they will give a regular employee backfill (manager perks but no additional pay) to help the managers out. The backfill will review calls and critique your work and do the managers work. Most people never make it to manager even while backfilling. A guy on our team has been backfilling for over 2 years. They make it seem once you backfill the manager position opens for you. But that's a lie. They do a lot of external hiring for managers instead of inside. Last hiring spree they hired 4 external hires for manager and only 2 internal. My manager has no idea how to do my job since he was hired externally. He can't give me advice or pointers since he doesn't know.  I am in the process of looking for other employment opportunities. But I will be replaced with the tap of a keyboard since most of my team has quit since starting. But that's the way it is here. Stop hiring so many outside managers. We bust our butts to make it to the top of the food chain and an external hire with no management experience can come in making lots more money than me but can't even assist me with my job since they have no clue how to do it.

We Apple long-timers call this ""drinking the kool-aid."" You get pretty good discounts for yourself (once a year) on merchandise. And, their benefits (medical, dental, 401k, and stock program) are pretty awesome for full-time employees. When being promoted from within, you WILL NOT get paid as much as someone being hired from outside the company. Not even close. This is how they save money... Also, you will never receive a substantial pay increase. Just don't expect it. Apple ""promotes"" people into new positions they create so that they don't have to hire someone else above that pay grade to do the job. For example: An Apple Genius is the tech that troubleshoots and fixes your stuff at the Genius Bar. An Apple Creative is the trainer that is very knowledgeable about software, who teaches you how to use your computer when you have a One-to-One membership. They both get paid much more than Specialists (salespeople). Apple invented the position ""Family Room Specialist"" to do a little of both of the Genius and Creative roles' jobs. They have to train for it, bust their butts to prove themselves, interview, etc. But after given the ""promotion"", they receive no pay increase. Thus, Apple now doesn't have to hire any more higher-paid Genii or Creatives. Another con? Is the con. They will (management) con you into believing that it's ok to be up front with them, and you can do anything... This is true only if it makes that manager look good. It's all just corporate retail politics. Lastly, you will always, ALWAYS be stressed out, and you will never know your schedule very far in advance.

There is no doubt in my mind that Apple is the king of retail and continues to be so well into 2014. I have seen plenty of frustrating experiences where Apple either will not fire, or for HR reasons cannot fire, people who meet the typical criteria of a burnt out retail employee - someone who is bad at their job, hates their job, and generally just negatively impacts the entire experience. Management is also full of these individuals, people who have been with the company for far too long and become rather jaded and lackluster, no longer interested in really creating an inspiring environment but just looking to show up to work and debate what places to go to lunch that day. There is a weird imbalance between employees who seem to really care for their job and want to do something with their lives vs. those who just seem to be there to get paid. Fire bad employees. I have seen far too many employees ruin customer experiences and detract from Apple's overall image and professionalism that management has simply swept under the rug rather than dealt with.",2.9479744,-8.4030485,0.0032789279230666644,0.04355074743106391,4.0,0.05555555555555555,0.5943948412698412

The ongoing training and integration professional improvement means that you can fill your brain, actually increase your skills and you will truly, madly, deeply learn your job. Most of the financial benefit comes from the halo effect when you leave. Before Obamacare, the benefits were amazing. Everyone is as smart as you, as nice as you, as humble as you and as talented. That's good for collaboration and can be bad if you are used to being a star, a keener, the key team member. However, if you have glacial patience and are financial sustainable at the level of your offer (as well as amazingly humble, able and talented), you can ascend. You have to be able to afford to work for years at whatever wage or salary they first bequeath and, if you are a manager-type, it will be a non-negotiable fraction of what you used to make and at least one demotion. If you do get one of the rare promotions, it will be because you have become (frustratingly) completely competent at the new job first and then waited for an eon for no apparent reason for the actual job title and tiny raise. If you have any sense of being a star or being entitled to advancement as a result of hard work, run Forest run. You will get discouraged and accept an outside offer before you get a promotion. A store used to be a pirate ship and now it's a priesthood. Embrace that and look for monks. For retention, select for people who can afford to work for what you are paying and select for humility and a desire to serve. There is literally no physical room for identity let alone ego in your tiny, sterile interior spaces. Stop hiring talent. Hire patience and non-reactivity in noisy close quarters.

Easy going, (in some respects) corporate culture. It is like any job, though, follow the rules, and you will have no problems. The problems start when you don't reach your assigned goals, and metrics. The metrics for At Home Advisors are not overly strict, nor impossible to meet. All you have to do is show up, do the job according to established practices ( and trust me, once you start doing that, it gets a whole lot easier, and your metrics are met......). The company is fun to work for, you get gifts every quarter (nice Apple-branded clothing, high quality commuter cups, and water bottles. Sometimes you get silly things as well, but that's just part of the fun of working there.) The training for At Home Advisors is about 5 or 6 weeks long, and it is kind of tough. It's not impossible, but it's not easy either. The overall atmosphere is fun, and it's fairly easy going as well. Working from home also has the benefit of being away from office gossip, and office politics. In addition there is the employee purchase plan for Apple devices, and, all kinds of discounts on other stuff as well. Apple builds their support around ""empathy"", and building a relationship with the customer, so they feel as if they are getting personal service from you. It's a good thing, too. I have done tech support in the past, both face-to-face and over the phone. Apples formula for doing things, while hard to get used to for the cynical, is really an effective way of dealing with customers. There is also plenty of opportunity to advance, and move into a full time gig. Also, your manager is their to support you. All of the managers I have had, have been involved, encouraging, and supportive, but there is no ""hand holding"". You are expected to take what you have learned, and help customers. Now, don't mistake that as meaning you are on your own with no support. Quite the opposite. There is tons of support, but once something is given to you to do, you are expected to complete it, or accomplish it in the agreed upon way. There are no excuses. Your manager is there to support you, help you sharpen your skills, and give you some best practices. All of my managers came up through Tech Support, going from Tier 1 to Tier 2, and then moving in to Team Managers. They have been there, they know how it works, and their knowledge is what will help you get to the next level. Constant Team Leader changes. I am now on my 4th team manager in 18 months, all of them have been good so far, but, it does get a bit old Hours and scheduling can be a bit crazy, you have to bid your shifts properly, so you get what you want. One day per weekend is required, and that is your 8 hour day. You are generally kept at 20 hours a week. If you take the benefits, (in my case it's for my entire family) anywhere from 25%-50% of your paycheck is gone. Benefits, however, are good. Customers... oh, the customers.... They can be draining.. Some of them are literally emotionally involved with their device. I kid you not. I have had customers crying because their Apple product is broken, and not working.

However, if we were doing our part and a customer was angry, then they would throw a tantrum and the managers would give into them All the Time and make Us Specialists look like the Bad Guys!!! I have seen times when a customer caused a scene because they couldn't return their two year old phone. As a result, the manager would give in and also give them a free phone case. The policy is 14 days and the policy never sticks. When it came to making an exception for an employee. OOOO Noooo But the Policy!!! Many of my co-workers were frustrated with the mixed messages of management.  During my time there, out store had a really harsh Time and Attendance Policy. If you were late or call out no matter the reason you would get an occurrence. The subway could of shut down or you might of had a death in the family, doesn't matter!!! Many great employees were fired because of this broken policy.  They had system called the NPP where the customers can rate you. This was one of the reasons I left. Your raise is dependent on this. The store can be way understaffed and a customer can write a negative review about the experience ( not having control over it) so that effects your raise. Also, Management wants you to sell as much AppleCare or One to One as possible. You can convince a customer to buy it without being pushy at all. Then later on the customer will have buyers remorse and slam you by giving you a negative NPP score by saying ""they were too pushy"". Then I would be blamed by the managers for being too pushy and getting a detractor. If I didn't Applcare then they would ask me to please improve my numbers. Again, mixed messages!!!  The NYC Market is run by very poor management. I understand that other markets and stores are much better. You are completely disregarding your Core Values.

44587,apple,2014,"Apple's corporate retail culture is unparalleled. There is no better retail store to work for, Apple Stores are diverse, dynamic learning laboratories for creative technology users and consumers.  The caliber of employee is beyond that found in any other retail environment I've worked in. Everyone there, for the most part, is there to genuinely help and ensure quality customer experiences. Most Apple retail employees are interesting and intelligent young people who participate in various activities outside of work -- outdoor sports, music, art, university, digital media, etc.  There is room for growth within Apple retail, but it will likely take a long while before one reaches corporate from there, if ever. Apple does provide opportunities for retail employees to participate in ""on-campus"" learning experiences at the Cupertino headquarters. They also have a leadership program (ASLP) for store employees to gain knowledge of every level of the retail experience the company provides.  You will learn a lot working for Apple, retail or corporate. The discounts (EPP+) and benefits (401K, stock options, health care, transit incentives) are a huge plus, too. Having visited numerous Apple Stores, two of which I worked for, it is clear that some stores are more enjoyable and productive than others. The feel of each store is very much dependent upon the employees that work within it, and sometimes managers fail to hire the brightest of the bunch, which often leads to frustration, inconsistency and unrest.  The sales environment can be extremely hectic, and some Apple Stores are more prone to chaos. Many stores have steel walls, wooden tables, stone floors and minimal sound mitigation, which can add stress to the day-to-day. There is also a certain mundane repetition that seems to develop after more than two years, a lot of explaining the same things, repeating analogies, and talking about the same products and services day in and day out.  Many employees, especially those under the age of 28, see working at the Apple Store as a stepping stone towards their dream jobs, which seldom exist within Apple, Inc. Pay closer attention to what happens on the sales floor. All-too-often, at least at my current store, many managers are more focused on menial tasks, sharing this weekend's plans, or complimenting customers on their shirt. Listen and observe the employees in the store you’re “managing.”  If management were to put more of an emphasis on building an effective, intelligent and dynamic team there would be fewer detractors (customers who give negative scores through Apple's feedback program), greater profits, higher stocks and more satisfied employees.",-23.303097,-4.4421268,-0.0842952111647102,-0.0035226352305317674,4.0,0.20407096171802055,0.4664659197012137

44659,apple,2014,"Apple Retail offers great pay...thats undeniable! Its a fast-pace retail environment unlike no other and is rarely a boring place to be. The pros are seriously limited to financial compensation and perks of that nature though. Discounted company stock is pretty great, benefits for all employees, product discounts (albeit rather minor discounts)...these aspects are where Apple excels compared to other retail operations They make a lot of empty promises that they can't keep at the store management level. I was there for 2 years and was ALWAYS performing within the top 5% of everyone in the store and yet, the VAST majority of open positions would go to new hires who have never worked in retail or for Apple. This inevitably caused incredibly low morale amongst the employees at our store. The people who WERE being promoted from within were those who would hang out with managers outside of work, and were usually the most fake employees in the building. If you can sacrifice dignity to move up, then you will be a rockstar in this company. If you refuse to be fake, and stab other people in the back, then you will have no shot at a career in retail. How much you know, or how good you are at making customers loyal to Apple for life, is irrelevant. However, I will say that when I would go and work for other stores outside of our market, it was a LOT different. It felt like how retail did back when Steve Jobs was still alive and Jon Browett was still in charge of retail. Ever since then, things have been all about numbers and politics. Back then, it was all about change and enriching lives. Management NEEDS to be help accountable for things they do or say. I've heard some REALLY messed up things coming out of management's mouths that are not only an HR concern, but also a direct insult to the Apple credo. For instance, at our store, an employee who was openly homosexual was harassed by a new manager for being ""too flamboyant"" around customers. Also, our store LEADER has on multiple occasions blasted people via email for moving to corporate positions without consulting with him first, myself being one of them! I was told that I went behind his back and that if I want to apply to ANY position within the company, I need to check with him first. This isn't cool and I know at least 3 other people who he said the same thing to. He also mistakenly sent an email out the entire store that was solely intended for the management team. In this email, he singled out an employee and said something pretty humiliating that everyone in the store read. He didn't even apologize for over a month. HR came in and investigated the situation by doing ""random"" interviews with employees but nothing changed and nobody was held accountable. This is NOT the Apple that I hired into, and it's this kind of thing that is the ONLY reason I left Apple Retail.  Also, changing for the sake of change is the most idiotic mentality I've ever seen when it comes to training employees. Things would ""change"" all the time and it was blatantly obvious that this was only the case because Apple claims to be all about ""change"". For instance, I had 100% customer satisfaction scores, and yet, I was told in my review with my manager that I need to change how I approach customers because studies show that approaching them with a product feature will drive my customer satisfaction score up. I'm already at 100%! Why the heck would I want to change a thing?!? Fixing things that aren't broken is a MAJOR recurring theme at Apple Retail and 9 times out of 10, we would pilot something in an attempt to drive up a metric that was already stellar, and it would fail miserably. Then we would spend the next couple months doing exactly what we were before JUST to bring that metric back up to where it was had we not tried to change anything. I'm COMPLETELY behind these kind of suggestions when someone is struggling maintaining metrics because that shows that something definitely needs to change. However, when someone has stellar metrics, it would be wiser for management to make an example of them and have them share their knowledge or techniques for success. Instead, they're just told their not doing things the way management would like and any opportunities for advancement go out the window at that point.",-4.329367,-11.125766,-0.03482435774259604,0.06500314461849918,3.0,0.011560342810342811,0.4643281268281267

The work can be rewarding, but it is what you make it (just like every job). Apple positions are very secure. There is room to grow and positions in Apple are highly regarded as some of the most difficult jobs to acquire, and if you don't want to stay with Apple, just being with Apple makes you very desirable to other employers. In the Genius role, it is pretty much non-stop angry customers. There are situations where you have to get a leader or security guard because of customers' temperament. Over time some people get ""burned out"" and should leave or move on, but sadly they don't. It's difficult to get fired when working for Apple so people who are content in their positions do what is necessary to stay, but have very little drive. This can be difficult on the people who are trying to grow with the company. Trying to improve numbers on the team can end up being a 1 person job (which, in turn, burns out that individual). Also, in San Francisco, there is a big turnaround for technicians because Apple does not pay the average rate for someone doing a technical support job. Salary for the Genius role needs to be more in line with the same tech support jobs in the immediate area. This way, the turnaround won't be so high in areas with many tech support jobs. Also, the Family Room process need an update. The family room journey is okay, but does not take into account a call-out or short-handed team. If the positions are not staffed properly, the ""journey"" doesn't work. I think, sadly, it is time to shut down the ""walk-in"" traffic at the Genius bar. Creative sessions are done by appointment only, why not the Genius Bar? This will make the scheduling easier (which will make technicians happy) and force technicians to be more accountable (because they HAVE TO finish their queue). If someone calls out, each technician on the team takes an even amount of the sick technician's appointments.

44895,apple,2014,"Each store has a little of its own culture, but most of them function as a large somewhat-unhappy, way-to-stressed family. I've retained more friends from Apple than I have from any other job. Dealing with crazy people really does bring people closer together. While it's a decently ok job and has many cons, there's a lot to learn from Apple's culture and way of doing things. I've learned how to be more patient, how to teach someone in a way that they'll retain the information, how to dumb down tech talk without making the other person feel stupid, and how to talk my way out of an argument. All great skills to have in life. Lots of great discounts on both Apple and 3rd party products they sell in store. With all the cons there are, it's a great place to learn, make some friends, and just get paid when you're in college. The pay is horrible when you consider how much money an average employee brings in. Most of management has no idea what they're doing. Store leaders are almost always out of touch with their employees and their store in general. Some people think you can get into corporate through Apple retail...Yeah that almost never happens. You will be forced to deal with some of the rudest customers I've ever seen. Apple really shot themselves in the foot back in the day when they offered free iPhone replacements on a regular basis for issues such as liquid damage, so it makes it tough to explain to customers that Apple doesn't do that anymore. It makes it tougher to sell Apple Care + and to tell a customer that it's going to be $250 to replace their iPhone 5s that they dropped in the toilette. If you have the opportunity to work at the genius bar, you will be expected to see one customer every ten minutes for mobile devices (ipad, iphone, ipod) and fifteen minutes for computers. When you take into account that Apple wants you to build a relationship with the customer, acknowledge their issue, assure them you'll do your best to get them out quickly and happy, and fix the issue, it's a difficult task to always stay on time. Your team is judged by being on time, getting great feedback from the customers who come in, availability at the genius bar, and even how long it takes to repair the computers you have. It's a lot to keep up with. Some stores have ridiculous standards for how many hours or days you must be available to work. At my old store, if you were full time they expected you to have completely open availability. So let's say you can work 40+ hours a week but you have to pick up your kid at a certain time every day so you show ""unavailable"" for that time, nope, gotta be part time. Pay attention to what's going on with your team. If they're unhappy or too stressed out, take the time to learn why and actually give a crap instead of ignoring the issue at hand. In the end, if they complain about you enough they can get you fired. I've seen it happen. Don't override their decisions. If a customer is asking for something ridiculous like a free iPhone replacement because they claim they let any liquid touch their phone even though it's obvious it's damaged, back your employee up. Don't make them look like the bad guy because you don't want a bad feedback comment. When your employees feel they can trust you, it makes your relationship that much better. And happy employees=happy customers.",4.3942885,-11.401701,0.01598821770527883,0.09316757812735933,3.0,0.0858736664064533,0.5169258792209612

Some of the best things I have learned in my life have been talking to an Apple Retail Manager when they are available. Managers are overworked and underpaid in retail stores. Usually there are only 2 managers to supervise a staff of 70-100 people. They can barely manage to talk to all 70 people in a shift let alone support them and think strategically about the work that they are doing  Managers are pushed to be on the floor at all hours which then means they can't meet with me for development, or hire people, or plan strategically, or even just do something fun with us.  By default managers then run from fire to fire and then they quit after a few years realizing this is what Apple Retail is going to continue to be.  Apple has three levels of in store leadership the store leader, the senior manager, and the manager. Frankly I don't see a lot of difference between the three and I would think that you would. In fact I have a manager that I think would do a better job of being a store leader than our store leader. At the very minimum he is better than both of the senior managers.  I am sure there is a difference in pay at each level but because he wasn't part of Gap brands before he came to Apple or some other retailer they put him into entry-level leadership.  Come on every one knows that retail isn't known for it's professionalism so bringing people from other retailers just serves to perpetuate that. I think Apple already knows that its retail leadership teams are spread too thin but I think it is simply about saving money. I do not think there are any plans to change or improve this for our leadership teams.  That frustrates me because I wanted to be a manager but I see what we do to the managers and I am not truly sure I want to be one.  Hopefully you fix it.

Many are unwilling to get out on the floor and actually help customers which, when it's busy and everyone is in the same color shirt can give a confusing message to customers. Additionally, they usually play favorites for promotions and ""career experiences"" so if the impression you make is negative in the first couple of weeks, it's going to take you a LONG time to get around that. Stop hiring managers who are unwilling to go out on the floor and help when it's busy or who are unwilling to even learn about what it exactly is that the specialists, FRS, etc do.

48709,apple,2014,"* STOCK PLAN + BENEFITS IS GREAT ( PROBABLY THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING EMPLOYED THERE ) * PAY IS BETTER THAN OTHER RETAIL JOBS OUT THERE * PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH ARE ACTUALLY DECENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE & HARDWORKING PEOPLE * YOU WILL LEARN ALOT OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT COMPUTERS, IPHONES, ETC I've been working for Apple Retail for a very long time and everything sure has changed , NIGHT AND DAY differences from back then.  Since the earlier days, it was all about enriching lives. Taking the time, making sure the customer had all the attention you can give them without being rushed into your next appointment . Nowadays, its all about enriching their pocketbooks and numbers ! Here are the core CONS that you will encounter , Let me break it down :  • A billion dollar company that LOVES to have short staffing. Apple refuses to put enough people on the sales floor. Ive seen frustrated customers wait impatiently for someone to help them purchase a computer yet THERE'S NO SALES PEOPLE TO HELP and they storm out of the store pissed off instead !! Yup ! There goes that sale ! Way to go APPLE !!!!!  • Everyone wears blue shirts . Its hard to distinguish who the technicians are and who the sales people are . a unified color of the shirt simply means EVERYONE IS EXPECTED TO PRETTY MUCH DO EVERYTHING no matter what position you have. Job Description ? There is NO SUCH A THING IN APPLE RETAIL . ( read on )  * GENIUS BAR / FAMILY ROOM ( aka the technical support area ) is all about NUMBERS. You are put on a queue where you are seen by a technician. You basically have 10-15 minutes with this customer and YOU MUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. Most stores require you to have an appointment booked ahead of time, and recently, its become standardized that ALL APPOINTMENTS MUST BE TAKEN. The genius bar is now cleverly crafted with new stations that ' get you started ' . No appointments ? sure just sit down and a technician will take a look and see if they can do the task for you. This basically allows more traffic to come through and more appointments to be taken. ( btw management WE'RE NOT STUPID !!! ) Work has been quadrupled to the point you are running around with your head about to fall off ! This department would work so well but the management will not put enough people to help out throughout the day ! The worst part about being in this department is breaks and lunches are always never taken on time !!!! You will basically end up hating your co workers for taking too long in their interactions or for them to refuse to help out because they are doing computer repairs. It just flat out SUCKS . This is the worst level of stress you will receive in the store . There's not a day I come home from work, not only physically exhausted but MENTALLY abused from all the things you go throughout the day ! l  * THE CREATIVE STUDIO ( aka one to one training ) will test your PATIENCE .  You will teach 70-80 year old customers who just purchased a computer and will end up coming back for repeated sessions for the next couple of weeks because they cant remember their passwords !  If you are extremely patient, well good luck cuz you're going to need it real badly when you're in this role !!!! Id say a good 10% of the sessions you will get are actual decent individuals who can grasp and learn what you teach, the other 90% will just be useless people who are just basically wasting their time ( AND YOURS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ) .  * The customers, especially the pissed off ones,can be a handful. Be prepared for an earful. Most are nice but majority are prissy, stuck up people who will EXPECT you to bend over and squeeze them in to have their iphone fixed ahead of everyone else. This would only be alleviated if the company actually put more people on the sales floor/ technical support areas so that the employees wouldn't get stuck in escalations  It is August 2014 and from my point of view , Apple Retail has changed drastically . its not the same fun place I remember it used to be . If you think im bullshitting , I've witnessed about 8 people from the genius bar resign over the past few months , and that says alot where the company is heading !  Quality in the service is disappearing, FAST. Its all about Q U A N T I T Y folks !!!!!!!!!  Quantity of how many appointments employees can take + Less Staffing = HUGE BONUSES FOR MANAGERS  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT WORKING FOR APPLE RETAIL ..ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS?  Consider yourself warned.  I'm already looking for a way out . its just a matter of time. Your employees are not idiots . Limiting the amount of staff per shift may give you guys bonuses/raises/incentives/etc --- but be advised that you will continue to lose more quality workers as this continues to go on.  Soon, I will be one of them .

Max % increase was 10%, and that is really rare to get!

48747,apple,2014,"1. Apple Retail tends to hire people who are sociable and creative, and it was fantastic to be part of a vibrant team with many shared personal interests. There was a strong community spirit and a willingness to help each other out. Working with the vast majority of my colleagues was a pleasure, I made many friends during my time with the company.  2. The Genius role is split between seeing customers to diagnose their issues, and physically repairing Apple hardware. I found a great deal of satisfaction in both the problem-solving and customer relationship management elements of the job. Diagnosing and resolving issues within tight time frames kept a healthy pressure up and provided clear performance goals. There was good support from management for personal development within the role. The service strategy changed a lot during my time at Apple (less attention on individual customers in order to serve a greater number), but that was an unfortunate reality of the growing demand. I still enjoyed the day-to-day work right up until I left Apple for a new opportunity.  3. Apple Retail has a young and diverse culture. Tattoos, bright hair and piercings are all completely acceptable among staff. Dress code was very relaxed... Wearing trainers every day and shorts in summer was bliss.  4. Genius pay is very good for a job that does not formally require a degree. I worked for Apple for nearly three years and received three incremental annual pay rises, leaving on ~£25k as a Genius with a year's experience in the role. Considerable discounts were available on Apple products for myself, friends and family. Apple employees received preferable rates in many of the local eateries and, most importantly, pubs. Store meetings and product launches were often effervescent affairs with free food, drink and entertainment. 1. Career progression abruptly halted once I reached the Genius role. I started off with Apple as a part-time sales advisor ('Specialist') and successive promotions happened quickly, but the Genius position sits in a comfortable little cul-de-sac thereafter. Geniuses in Apple Retail are remunerated well but cannot easily continue a technical career into Apple Corporate as there is often a qualifications barrier to entry. Perhaps understandably, Apple does not have a career pathway that allows Geniuses to train for Corporate roles in the absence of degrees in computer science, electronic engineering or similar. The general consensus seemed to be that while there is no stigma attached to working for Apple Retail, it is held at arm's length from Corporate and aspirational talk from management about moving across as part of one's career path is largely lip-service. Multiple colleagues of mine had secondments to Corporate but were not offered permanent positions. My advice is that if you want a role within Apple as a wider organisation, it is better to gain more relevant experience elsewhere than get your foot in the door with Apple Retail.  2. See 'Advice to Management'. Apple has an all-smiling culture of frequent high-fives, hugs and friendliness. This was normally lovely but such warm behaviours became painfully contrived whenever management were trying make changes that would have a negative impact on employees (holiday restrictions, irregular shifts etc.). During my time with the company, most managers seemed compelled to dismiss challenges to such issues with a wearily forced smile and a condescending statement about how not being able to take time off is actually a positive opportunity to 'transform the lives' of more customers. Managers were often very nice people but confidence in them to sincerely respond to concerns was low.  Apple Retail management should learn that when it needs to implement a difficult change for its staff, leaders must stop patronising them with some heavily-spun 'greater good' nonsense, and have an adult and honest conversation about why such changes are required. This was by far the most frustrating thing about working for Apple.",-14.597148,-3.9989393,-0.0697718290052588,0.021641517256796142,4.0,0.2121883116883118,0.5027857142857142

It was my first job out of uni and I was ambitious and motivated by the prospect dangled in front of me of promotion to the creative level.  On the plus side Apple does train staff in many areas that will help you land future jobs, the working environment is casual and having Apple on your resume opens doors. My starting wage was only £7.50 per hour (this was in 2008) and Apple doesn't pay commission which I think is totally unfair. I was selling upwards of £5000 worth of products a day (in a small store) and I earned just as much as the concierge who just stood at the door and said hello to customers. I was told I would be given a full time contract but that never came despite my hard work and consistent top sales - instead another part timer was hired. I asked to be enrolled in the creative training offered and a few months later a number of staff were taken for creative training (including the part timer hired after me) but I was left out with no explanation given. Perhaps they wanted me to keep their sales up instead. The middle management is terrible, even more so in the big stores in London where I worked later - Regent street for example, has 500 employees and in my interview my manager admitted he didn't know half the staff.

Training has become really lack, instead of teaching staff about the actual product (especially mac) the focus has been shifted to customer service focus. They treat you like children i.e. you have to ask permission for toilet breaks, ask to go on lunch break which are often scheduled far to early on in your shift (School like culture).  The management are extremely fake and patronising, speak to you as if you are 10 years old. Although there are no direct sales targets, they are extremely focused on the feedback received from customers so they can look good. Some of the best staff put on performance plans as they are claimed to not be innovative enough! Too many managers on the shop floor at one time simply baby sitting.  There used to be a relaxed culture that resulted in the staff delivering amazing customer service as they were generally happy, but now everyone is forcing themselves to look busy in a bid to avoid being approached by a manager. You have to act fake the whole shift, so actors this may be a good role of choice!  Also the staff discounts are rather stingy, only one real discount per year per product. No bonuses. Invest in training again!! It will naturally have an effect on customer experience.

56312,microsoft,2014,"As many have stated the benefits and pay at Microsoft are mostly without compare. A healthy dose of 'work/life balance' and a solid set of benefits made this an attractive place to work for many new and mid-career people. Recent changes to the review model is a huge step towards treating employees with the dignity and respect that they deserve. Cons will vary by division, so my experiences may not be representative of all - or most - groups. Within the the advertising groups ( i.e. in OSD or A&O) Microsoft is victim to a very subtle 'passive/aggressive' culture that seems somewhat pervasive of a lot of companies in the Seattle area (so, not just a MS phenomena). Disagreements or direct confrontation is frowned upon, while 'back channel' negotiations and positioning drive influence. If you prefer a culutre that is far more direct and vocal, Microsoft may not be a great environment or experience for you. Promotions and advancement can be very slow unless you have an acceptable 'alpha dog' personality and or othereise are a strong contributor and belong to high profile demographic groups. If you don't fit these categories, make sure you get a level and salary you will be happy with when you start for at least two years or more as you will very likely not be considered for promotions until your second or third review (unless you stand out like a rock star). Smaller companies reward and promote much quicker, so if you are used to or expect that, you may be disappointed. While Microsoft makes much of its merit-based promotions/rewards system, its really difficult to believe it. This is the problem of any large company where promotion and reward decisions are made further and further up the org hierarchy, so its just really difficult for all but the most signifciant (or narcisitic!) to get noticed. This means that employees who consistently deliver good work but don't generate a lot of awareness can often be overlooked. The lack of transparency around 'level's is one of the problems IMO: Promotions are secretive and not acknowledged in most groups, which is kind of weird and doesn't lead to a lot of trust in a system if management is not willing to acknowledge who gets promoted and who does not. The work you do may be exciting, but there is a 12 to 18 month cycle where the project/product you are working on will go from high profile to mundane or (as seen recently) a target for personnel reductions. This leads to one of the solutions and problems at Microsoft in that you are going to have to change internal jobs frequently to stay relevant (e.g. 18 months to 2 years). There is little value placed on consistent results generation, Microsoft wants rock stars who will generate internal enthusiasm and garner resources and rewards, which leads to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy (until they ultimately flame out, see Xbox One launch!). -Stop out-sourcing critical operations functions. The future leadership with real knowledge of our platforms, tools and day to day busines is now being trained and developed in outsource organizations. Bring entry-level operations roles back in as FTE's. This is a short term fix which is robbing MS of future leadership. - Listen and share. Stop the secrecy around business planning. You hire smart people, treat them that way. - Hire experience over personality. MS has a habit of hiring internally based on the right 'personality' and is afraid of hiring externally for senior leadership roles. This is a mistake and leads to a senior leadership team with a very lmited experience and knowledge of the advertising business. - Be humble.",-12.283295,2.998381,-0.07023385740989527,0.018264500066000066,3.0,0.12959834766172795,0.48099404507855203

56419,microsoft,2014,"Lots of talent and people to learn from, decent machines to work off of, working on Next Big Game can be exciting, well stocked kitchen, good parking. From a contract point of view~ You're going to be disposable as a contract. The best thing to do about it is just accept it and do your work and not take anything personally. Don't get starry eyed about maybe going fulltime there, you will find at least a dozen contractors who have been going in and out for years and never gone fulltime (and many of them deserve it). Instead of hiring in, lots of jobs are being outsourced overseas. When your contract year is up, just take your 100 days off and hope you'll have work when your break is over. By the way, your ""break"" means unemployment, which means filing at the unemployment office and applying for jobs every week. This lifestyle as a contract will be forced upon you.  Lots of closed door meetings won't include you. You won't have any say on what level you work on, if you're moved to another team, and won't be involved in finding solutions. Even if you don't have any say in the matter as a junior, there's a lot that can be learned simply by being a part of meetings.  You'll be forced to use a contract vendor and they take a huge cut of your salary. There is no apply directly at Turn10 (this seems to be the Microsoft standard). You will end up working a ton of overtime into the evenings and weekends before deadlines. Don't be surprised if your lead gets to go home at a decent hour to have dinner because they have ""family"". You won't be given the same courtesy if you wish to stay valuable, whether or not you have a family of your own. If it's the holidays and you are forced to take time off due to studio closures, hope you saved up enough money so you don't take a big hit on your paycheck. Many contracts feel forced to work surrounding weekends so they can get a decent few days off for vacation. Any overtime hours must be pre-approved. Your lead sometimes will try to give you too much work for a 40 hour workweek and you'll be forced to work some unpaid hours to keep up with their demands or have to admit that this is more than 40 hours which makes you ""slow"" (work smart, not hard. But also recognize when the deadlines aren't feasible).  Due to the realism of the games, everything will be made off of strict supply of reference. This can be cool, but if you are an artist that likes to create orcs and dragons etc from an artistic vision rather than a realistic one, this job will be just that - a job. Don't get your hopes up about making anything for your portfolio either, all the cool stuff will most likely be outsourced. Not to mention there's so much overlap in the levels that nothing will really be your own to claim. Don't be surprised if someone takes the bulk of your work like a model, applies a texture that Tech Art made, and plops it in their portfolio claiming it as their own.  If you're not really interested in racecars or motorsports in general, pretend that you do. Learn how to act excited even when you're really not to better fit in with the studio. Don't bring up any interests you have that will make you seem weird or not part of the team. See if you can get an invitation to ""Guys Night"" on Tuesdays to get beer with your male-only coworkers (yes, this was a thing). Never mind the fact that most of the studio is male and that this is excluding the minority.  Upper management doesn't care about you personally. They care if you get stuff done on time and done well so don't get involved and thinking you're making friends with anyone (it's best to just accept this early on in order to function). Fulltime employees are too busy watching out for themselves within the Microsoft foodchain and don't care to mingle with contracts much.  People do get sabotaged in to losing their jobs here. Some leads will hold you back from allowing you to doing your job with conflicting and false instructions, impossible deadlines (not just difficult ones, impossible), create bugs and shift the blame to the contract etc. Upper management, HR, whoever, they don't want to hear about it or deal with it if you're contract. If the lead says you won't jump high enough, you're out no matter how much evidence you have of the lead being inadequate.  I've never been happier to end a contract. Out of the few jobs I've had in the game industry this was the worst of the lot. I would not recommend this to any one planning on going in as contract unless they really need the work. If you end up at Turn10 as contract never stop looking for other work in the industry. Don't commit to a job that will never commit to you. Stop treating your contracts like garbage. They have a lot of potential to really do well in the company and make up most of your workforce and deserve more respect. There's no way your company would be able to ship Forza without them.",5.7179585,-16.928196,0.013627211432604796,0.08160666598673498,1.0,0.07977513227513225,0.46469135802469136

56429,microsoft,2014,"Working for Microsoft has been the highlight of my professional life. I've been there for 20+ years and, once upon a time, the company was agile and each group operated as a small company. What's great? The very very smart people. The company has made tremendous strides in its products & technology and customers genuinely want to see Microsoft and to use its technology. It's been great to have been part of something that has - literally - changed the world. It's generally easy enough to move from one role to another in the company after a few years if you were successful in your previous role.  I had a hard time with this review - there's so much that's great about Microsoft. The biggest problem they have today is that the company promotes unqualified people to management positions (at all levels) and those managers then blindly adhere to ""policies"" that just don't make sense from a business standpoint. What's not so great? It's a different Microsoft today. The values the company expressed to its employees through benefits, salary, stock, and promotion opportunity have changed - some of it is related to Steve & Bill going, although the changes started before both of them left. The benefits are so-so today for a company of Microsoft's stature. The cut throat nature between groups and individuals is stunning - to get to Level 65 you have to demonstrate that you're willing to be ruthless and will stab a co-worker in the back. You can't succeed at Microsoft unless it is at the expense of a co-worker. Sad. You MUST be connected in order to get beyond Level 64. So many employees spend all their time networking and building those relationships at the expense of everything else. It's very disheartening to see those folks rocket up the career path to greater rewards (stock, salary, promotions) when, really, they haven't done much to advance the business. Those that focused on helping others to be great, who focused on doing the right thing for smart business? Well, if you haven't networked to the nth degree, you'll be stack ranked. The notion that Microsoft no longer stack ranks couldn't be further from the truth. My last review (and likely my last with the company) resulted in me being ranked at the bottom of my group despite having outperformed half of the group in terms of RBI attainment. Coming in at the bottom? Means you're out the door in 6-8 weeks. Period.  You will put in long hours, although to be fair, you have to do that anywhere to be successful. You will not have a pleasant work/life balance. I rarely recall taking more than a consecutive week for vacation in over twenty years. I lost vacation every year. I never took time off without having to engage at work in some form or fashion. Perhaps that's a fault on my end? Maybe - but it sure was expected. The stock price is doing well - so maybe some of these changes are good. People are your most important asset - for far too long Microsoft has consumed its employees and then replaced them on the whim of an illogical HR policy that the bottom ten percent have to go every year. The ability of a manager to stack rank and dump a consistently high performing employee based upon nothing other than a subjective feeling with no oversight? Please. That's bad business, stupid, and will eventually result in a major payout when a former employee sticks with the lawsuit.

Culturally, Microsoft has a challenge of too much in fighting, too many people worried about show casing sales type slides in PowerPoint versus the content shared being real or providing value to the company because managers do not understand what they should be looking at, no emphasis on results and more about marketing (mostly vaporware), too many arguments of a word or term such as one that remembered ""what is a application versus a platform?""

If you enjoy thinking through massive amounts of ambiguity and aren't driven to create processes to fix those systems, you will do well at Microsoft.  Microsoft is also an amazing place to build a vast network via consulting firms and FTEs at the company. You will also benefit from learning how a multitude of other companies are set up and structured. I've found this to be incredibly helpful in determining what teams and companies you would like to create one day as an entrepreneur or what places/structures you would find most valuable for employment. The company is struggling with massive amounts of change coming from the new CEO, especially in marketing. Microsoft marketing is very unstructured, lacking ability to understand or utilize data to make informed decisions about customer interactions. Because it is such a political place, teams will often group together to discount an individual or team that attempts to create structure via analytical marketing. Marketing campaigns are often not measured, and the monetary waste and lack of frugality is substantial. The company overall lacks a pulse on their customers' interest/pain points/goals, especially in B2B.  Leadership lacks vision, long-term goals, and ability to simplify or communicate. Management is highly political, some teams hire groups of people to pad for a riff without ever attempting to develop the new employees. Employees typically spend time managing vendors and lack the understanding of how the job is actually done. With technical roles, the vendor teams who are in the details will often indicate roadblocks that, if the FTEs understood the details, wouldn't exist.  Although the company used to freely promote from within, promotions are much more difficult to come by now. Managing people should always include developing them and helping them find their passions. Be more direct with people about ways they can contribute to the company. Too much ambiguity creates lack of focus for many. If you contribute to others, they will contribute to you. Don't be in competition with your own employees!",-17.495602,10.282611,-0.09550942159440848,-0.019258937109759143,3.0,0.13393141945773526,0.5403708133971291

The deductible at the beginning of the year is high, but MS contributes and I've never had a problem finding a doctor that's part of the system. The company culture varies from division to division, but generally its supportive and cooperative. There are cases where people were promoted that I didn't feel should have been, but they were fairly rare so by in large, promotions were earned and justified. Even more rare were the cases where someone should have been promoted and wasn't. When I was promoted, the benefits were good, generally a 3-5% salary increase (+ merit on top of that), 15%+ bonus (depending on level), and equity shares. As for people, I worked with a lot of different teams and I didn't get along with everybody, but I always felt the vast majority of people were very smart and talented. A big problem toward the end of my tenure at MS was process and compartmentalization. I'm sure this is a problem with a lot of large companies, but I felt over the years that different groups were spun off to tackle different problems during the shipping of Windows. This sounds good, but in practice it leads to conflicting priorities between groups with the focus less and less on the end goal of shipping a quality, innovative product. For example early on in Windows, test and dev teams owned their own test labs and machines. Now its set up such that there is a lab team and an execution team and their priorities are to keep the lab clean and machines busy, which isn't always the best thing for the dev/test teams trying to ship a product.  Also, another thing to watch out for is competition. MS competitive review model can lead to grandstanding and throwing people under the bus for the sake of ones own review. Some competition is good, but not when it leads to these negative results, which I have seen.  Last I would say is honesty of execs. Because of the layoffs and the way they were handled by execs, the morale of the Windows group is pretty low. Some of the recent confusing directives from Windows execs on what exactly is the job function of a SDE and SDET and the constant reorgs are taking a toll.

If you do get on a start-up type of team, you are well protected in the warm corporate womb of cash flow, and you will have a lot of freedom to innovate.  Of course the benefits are king. I think it dates back to the hey day of Microsoft dominance, and I don't expect that to last forever, but it's been a very nice starting boost to my finances work here as my first company.  The company is going through necessary changes without which it would definitely die a slow death (even though there is cash to burn for years). I know these are painful changes for a lot of people who were laid off. However from the longer term strategy perspective as well as the impact to my personal day to day, I think these changes are mostly positive and from what I can tell, many of my co-workers do as well.  Despite what you may feel about Microsoft's stack from a technical perspective, you can't deny they have made a huge impact on computing. They were first company in many ways to exemplify the power of software to the world. There is the attitude here of wanting to make software to make the world a better place. Because it's a big company with a tall hierarchy, communication and organization of teams can sometimes be a problem. The result can be pointless kind of punting of responsibility, or the opposite, of fighting over territory. I don't know why this happens, but it reeks of bad management and too much of it.  There are many areas of Microsoft where it is hard to make a big difference. Some projects are bogged down by scope creep from feature requests over years. Other areas are just more risk averse. This results in a slogging kind of maintenance work instead of developing cool features.  This company attracts people who are exceptionally smart, but also lazy and greedy. Once well established, the smart and lazy thing is to hold onto their power and money instead of taking the risks of innovation- and often these are the type of people in upper management, who have been there the longest. I am sure you could say that about any large company but Microsoft may be a special case. Being a company that ballooned several times over in a short amount of time, it was inevitable some people got promoted too much, too quickly.

Managing global scale incidents, and being a part of delivering a really big product is exciting. You will hone some skills here- but just what they are will depend entirely on where you end up. I should preface this by saying: Microsoft, like every giant corporation, depends enormously on where you land. If you know the people you'll be working with, it's a GREAT opportunity. I rolled the dice to become an FTE, and that was a huge mistake. There are segments of this company that are 20 years behind the industry.  It's easy to convince yourself that you had an influence- but as a Service Engineer, you won't. Y They'll interview you and ask if you can code. If you can, find another job. Once you're hired, you can expect to NEVER code again- I even had managers get angry with me when I simply checked in fixes to problems myself. I was subjected to 9-10 months of constant reorganizations, with almost NO work requested of me during this time. It was maddening. My team was put on death watch for a collection of old services(killed by Nadella, but rightfully so!). So there I was, as a top performer in my level, stuck patrolling a product cemetery while my former product group plowed forward into new and shiny things. This is because Microsoft ONLY respects Devs. Not SE's, not Testers, and maybe not even PMs. As an SE your opinion, and your leadership's opinion, will never matter. Unless someone with a developer title agrees with you. The job a Service Engineer is to absorb the technical debt of your development team. I found myself in this job getting paid more than ever, while people expected less than ever of me. It was a depressing, demoralizing year, and I am delighted to be paid more for doing more elsewhere. My resume grew almost none, other than the value of their name. Either figure out what you want Service Engineers to be, or get rid of the discipline.

56709,microsoft,2014,"By in large the people are smart and committed to joint success. The pay seems good. Benefits are great, although changes in health benefits mean that it is no longer 'the best', it's still top tier. The majority of Microsoft people work hard and want to succeed. You get the best technology you need to do your job. There are many different types of jobs, careers and professions. From entertainment to productivity to business process software to hardware. This means you can change teams/divisions and have very different experiences and build different knowledge. In some ways it's like ""many companies in one"", in a good way. Whilst all companies struggle with diversity in high tech Microsoft does feel better than many. It has more to do but is doing well and headed in the right direction on most diversity fronts. Ballmer instilled a sycophantic culture in the company which is taking time to work its way out of the system, despite Satya's best efforts. Some of the Presidents are still very much like this, don't you dare disagree, even if you have the data. If they say 'jump' you better jump. This is common in many teams. It is demoralizing and results in a culture of fear in many teams. Many people at Microsoft work far too hard (but not smart) with little benefit to their careers or personal life. To get to Director, then GM and so forth you have to give up your life in progressive chunks. So you better love what you do. People should take a break and gain some perspective at times (diversity). Employees should aim to work smart. There is a lot of busy work at Microsoft, emails and meetings are chronic. It can take a while to understand the culture and landscape and therefore who you need to work with to get things done. If you don't find the right person you run the risk of invoking the wrath of another team inadvertently. However due to the level of busy work and thus lack of awareness of the big picture often those with the wrath often will have been made aware but were too 'randomized' to be able to engage with you until you do something that crosses swords with them. Then it hits the fan. Change happens on geological time scales. Those with an entrepreneurial or innovative mind set often find this frustrating and leave, including many younger hires. This has an overall negative impact on diversity. This in turn has impacted Microsoft's ability to innovate and compete in the past two decades. Satya is working to change this culture, to make it more dynamic, but that takes time. Politics is very much a part of life and significant energy must be spent on internal positioning and marketing of your own work. To be fair with 100K+ employees these facts are not surprising. For long term success you do need to factor this into your work planning, if you spend to much time doing and not enough time marketing then you will only ever get so far. The opposite is being at a small company and having to market your work... externally. However of course if you don't want to do marketing, promotion, communications or advertising then you may prefer to work at a smaller company where those responsible for the marketing et al are specifically in such roles.The irony at Microsoft is many people in marketing are not very good at marketing their work, at best people don't know what they are working on, at worst they do market their work but it comes across as self promotional. Internal marketing is a subtle, collaborative skill. Get rid of the Presidents and CVPs who demand sycophants. They instill a 'yes man' culture that hurts the company. MUCH more middle management clean out is required (GM, CVP). These ""leaders"" are nothing of the sort. Put a keen eye on leadership, hiring, promotion and development. Many ""leaders"" are not doing what they need to build and nurture healthy performing organizations. Presidents who never walk the halls? Seriously? Two words: TALENT PIPELINE - you can't have teams only staffed with 62+. It kills diversity, reduces innovation and forces the more experienced to task switch between low level and more advanced tasks which in turn reduces efficiency. The MACH program isn't enough. More undergraduate focus required across all disciplines. Don't put so much value on having an MBA, most MBAs are either worthless or simply bread group think and conformist thinking. MBAs do not encourage innovation or a competitive attitude. To keep the younger talent you need to execute on the promise of a more nimble, agile organization where people can build and sustain amazing careers that excite. Otherwise young, promising talent will continue to flee for the Bay Area Rethink the leveling system which causes a stagnation at level 64. The company has promised for a long time ""non management career progression"" however the real rewards continue to be seen by those in management positions as non people manager 64s don't have the ability to scale their ""business impact"" as those in leadership positions do. Have more of a focus on measuring managers on managing. This would help.

56791,microsoft,2014,"As a company Microsoft has great benefits and good pay. It’s a beautiful campus (soccer and softball fields, sand volleyball courts, trails etc…). Microsoft also has a lot of products. It is one of the few companies where you can work on an OS, developer tools, database engines, cloud services and games. If you get tired of working on one product you can move teams to work on something entirely different. You also get the opportunity to work with really smart people who have the same passion and technical interests that you do. Building software is Microsoft’s business. It’s not an IT or hardware shop it is a software company. Management is not honest or open. I found out about a change in my position\team structure by seeing an email distribution list. My manager at the time could not be bothered to tell me I had to make an appointment with him to find out. You can be surprised in your reviews. Very clique’ ish, if you are not in the same clique’ as you manager get out of that team and find a new one. There are way too many managers who can not write code, although they like to think they can.  Managers can be very demeaning to individuals. I had one manager tell me that the best management book he had ever read was a book on raising children. Even the current CEO, Satya Nadella, has made a similar reference. This is very insulting. I’m an adult you should treat me like one.  Microsoft is not an innovative company. When I joined the company the industry was reading books explain how Microsoft ships software. Of course the industry has passed Microsoft by and now Microsoft is not even mentioned in article that describe the direction the industry is taking. Not sure if there is any advice to give to Microsoft management, because they never listen, but here it goes. Be open and honest. Stop wordsmithing. Example the old review model was known as a stack ranking, but it was always call “calibration”. It’s not, people are put in a stack from top to bottom. Calibration only happens when you have to make the review numbers fit a model. Hire managers that are courageous. There are too many bullies in the upper ranks, you need managers who can stand up to them. Too many managers don’t live the Microsoft values. For example they are not able to give bad news. Be honest where you are at as a company. Microsoft is not an industry leader, in some markets it is a legitimate contender, in others it is simply an also-ran. Respect the rank and file troops. Financial rewards are fine, but they only work in the short term. Too many directors/managers are too far removed from the very people who work really hard to make them successful.

Huge company so there is the possibility to change roles quite easily. The pay is quite good especially because the main location is in WA. Great bus that brings you all over campus. Some new cool Microsoft devices. My main criticism is that it is not a company that values women in the workplace. I have not observed women getting promoted and women from technical fields are rarely being hired. Teams remain disproportionately male even compared to recent statistics from Google and other competitors. Little effort is made to proactively recruit women in technical positions. Managers from my division regularly and openly discredit women. They bully them (from my personal experience). It feels like Anchorman over there. The maternity/parental benefits are BS. I took them and it cost me a poor review (I was doing great before and in all prior reviews).  If you are in my situation, know that a lot of tech companies are proactively hiring women, publishing their statistics as cause for change, and rewarding women for their good technical work. The underlying belief in other companies is that women have equal capacity to be technical and do technical work. This is not the case at Microsoft. Credit is frequently given to male co-workers on the basis of their arrogance and posture. The presumption is that technical contributions in collaborations come from men. This is promoted by managers at many levels. For instance, women are frequently required to justify more of the technical claims on patents then their male counterparts on similar patents. The presumed inequality is part of everyday engagements.  Real equal opportunity teams may exist in the company. Just be sure to interview your future Microsoft colleagues and understand the culture you are going into. I have excellent offers in other places now, and I am taking the one that best fits my personality and values. I know I will have a great impact there. I just wished I had moved out sooner from an environment that was toxic for my health.  There is no collaboration possible, and unless you are a very vocal person and snarky to a fault, more arrogant people steal the credit for your work. I have struggled with this lack of collaboration and very competitive atmosphere. I was hoping that with the Nokia integration, a more collaborative culture would influence Microsoft leaders, but unfortunately it did not happen and all of those guys got fired anyway.  Regarding the interview process, the recruiter really tries to lowball you compared to other companies. This was my experience interviewing initially and then later interviewing internally. Crap tactics like acting baffled and surprised at basic packages offered by many of their competitor companies are the norm. Can they understand more collaborative techniques and work together on a good package? They do not reward PhDs. They do not reward the caliber of the institution you're coming from. It is because most of the management lack graduate education and believe education is useless (I heard it many times at work).  A minor thing, no free food, and food becomes quite expensive if you have only 20minutes to eat and need to eat in the local expensive cafeteria in the Commons (about 10-15$ a lunch). Something to budget.  The culture is really engraved in every manager who has been there from the start. Of course, you can find an excellent team (it does exist!) and if the work is a good fit, go for it. Be sure to probe the team's culture and get to know who will be your skip level. Maybe another style of leadership needs to take place, less bullying and more communication would be a first step.

I previously worked at a company which was arguably a better engineering company but the lack of business focus led to software projects not having longevity and ultimately to the collapse of the company.  The second is the people. It's said that if you are a jazz musician and you're the best in your band, you need to change bands. There is very little danger of topping out in Microsoft. There are always excellent skilled engineers to challenge you. Microsoft leadership stalled for a decade or so where more focus was paid to just business rather than a balance of business and engineering. The top echelons of compensation are epic, competition is fierce and winning is defined by profitability which has led to thinning of the product herd to only the most obviously profitable (or necessary) investments. Satya's leadership has hope of changing this but when you see references to Microsoft's environment being ""toxic"" this is the root cause with the old stack ranking system in a supporting role.

Do not look for your organization to guard your own work/life balance, it's up to you (as it should be but be cautioned).

57102,microsoft,2014,"Working @ Microsoft can be out of this world. Especially Main Campus. There is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience. The diversity of people (be it cultures, age groups, backgrounds, genders, education) is amazing. Even the products that Microsoft creates is diverse. Compare that with Google or Facebook who only make advertising revenue. Your experience will vary between teams, but one thing that was consistent (for me, at least) is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes. Though I had the opportunity to work on some popular products, the only way I could ever get my work done (according to expectations) is if I stayed late in the day (most of the time was spent in meetings, dealing with build processes, iterating specs with the team, answering literally hundreds of e-mails a day, helping test team troubleshoot issues) -- unfortunately, a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload, and in those cases where it does, it's almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take, since it relies on your entire team to work 100% efficiently. I believe work/life balance is actually possible here, but it's only at the expense of getting a positive review. Accountability is important, but most of the time, it felt like I was taking the blame (or being punished for) someone else's poor performance on the team. At the same time, you don't want to point fingers, because it makes you look equally bad. Really the only time I was happy was when I was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule, or I was on a team with no slackers. Sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload (say if they were more junior people in their role) and management would expect you to help them do their job, but would not properly account for this in the estimates.  Over time I eventually learned to manage these things better with politics. Yes, people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem, but at Microsoft, the politics are significantly magnified. People are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy. Therein lies the true problem. I eventually left Microsoft, since it felt like most of my time (almost 70%) was spent politicking and handling processes. Coupled with a decrease quality in the products (the gradual results of their work environment) and a lot of other, good people leaving the company. Microsoft seemed to be going downhill.  Though Enterprise and Azure have really taken off recently, I don't think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of Windows revenue in the end. Surface was an unfortunate flop, and Windows Phone + Bing are sucking money from the company. Xbox 360 was doing great when I left, but now even Xbox One is looking like a poor performer, which is really concerning for the company as a whole, when you combine these things together. Office and Azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though Office 365 has showed promise, its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in Office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of Windows desktops.  So please be careful. It's no surprise they had layoffs recently. Despite most of them being in the Nokia division (because of the Nokia merger) still a considerable chunk of few people in Redmond (even top performers) were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in. They were forced to leave or re-interview for a new positions in the company (which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs). A similar approach was used in 2009. It was devastating to morale. Coupled with the ""layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year"" really would not recommend anybody apply to Microsoft at least until late 2015.  The company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self ""more efficient."" But it's too soon to tell what that really means. Some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work/life balance, while at the same time, they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours.  None of this is encouraging. Luckily, these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance.  So now is definitely *NOT* the time to consider Microsoft. Look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation. Reduce the insane level of politics. Eliminate unnecessary processes and make them more efficient.

People are willing to collaborate when invited, but there's not a great culture of inviting collaboration.

Similarly, people have their own ideas about priorities, and aren't always willing to listen or collaborate on aligning priorities.  Often teams build what they want to build rather than figure out what customers need and how to work with other teams to deliver that.  There is a culture of only solving problems by programming.

57273,microsoft,2014,"There isn't a lot. The overall package is perhaps a little over market. The health insurance used to be excellent, but has since been abandoned. This company has failed in almost every way it could. With its stack ranking system it aggressively pitted its own people against each other and wholly sacrificed any software company's most critical asset - cooperation. Amazingly, in their greed to squeeze out more productivity, senior management failed to predict that this would happen. This is supposedly a company of exceptionally bright people, and yet management could not predict something as obvious as that? Along with cooperation, they lost morale, enthusiasm, innovation and team spirit. Working for Microsoft is like being in the Mafia, where every team and every individual is looking to take each other out. This is a verbatim quote from my former manager: ""When you talk to someone from {Team X}, smile, but hold a knife behind your back"". Those two teams, which needed to work closely together to achieve any modicum of success, were locked in an epic WAR which was dysfunctional, ultimately laughable, and most of all *typical* at Microsoft. Neither side shared an ounce of information about their system, critically needed for the other side to integrate their software into, and the result was an execution failure as absolute as the disregard for the final product that each contributor shared. Like a Big Brother-style reality TV series, Microsoft brings out the worst in people, and not surprisingly, in the software they need to produce as a team. Also, do not think that you will be able to innovate at Microsoft. They talk (read: lie) a big game about innovation, but the fate of new ideas is that they take a long (several years), winding and highly political campaign path and ultimately always end in the trash bin. Unless, of course, Google releases the same idea in the meantime, then there might be a chance. Why? Because Microsoft does not innovate. It never has. Its MO is ""embrace and extend"". Wait for others to invent, copy the successful inventions with more resources, and try to steal those inventions away from others. The other great failure of this company was not to recognize that that model could only have success in the slow-moving 20th century. I remember being brought into an all-hands meeting where it was explained to us that we need not worry about Google's acquisition of YouTube. Now that we've seen its success, we were told that Microsoft was going to come into the market second and trounce the competition, as it always does, with its new product ""MSN Soapbox"". Yea, OK. Has anyone ever heard of that? If you work at Microsoft, you will be told that they want you to innovate, but it is literally only an internal propaganda campaign. Lying to the troops ultimately does not inspire them. My primary advice to senior management is this: If you have been there during the bulk of the company's ""lost decade"" then you should resign - in shame. How does a company that dominates the market of software, with a billion in revenue and hundreds of millions in the bank, that owns the OS of 90% of computers on earth, with a solid grasp on the hearts and minds of computer enthusiasts worldwide, coming into the 21st century in which the synergy of computers and the internet are about to create a new technical revolution even bigger than the last - the industrial revolution, lose all of that, and barely register a blip next to the century's new giants Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook? It isn't easy. It takes so much more than severe incompetence. It takes a profound human failure. It takes the conscious choice of greed over vision, of profit over your people, of internal competition over cooperation, of theft over innovation, of lying over being candid with your employees and the outside world. After the Vanity Fair article ""How Microsoft Lost its Mojo"" exposed the failure of the stack ranking system, Microsoft officially abandoned it. Forgetting for a moment what it says about the caliber of senior management that it takes its advice from Vanity Fair, it was a good move. They really should have come up with that on their own. But it is too little too late. The damage has been done. If you are newly-employed management and you genuinely want to change things, then place cooperation and true innovation at the core of your values, and it is possible that Microsoft will escape the fate of IBM, whose PE ratio incidentally hovers right around that of Microsoft's today.",-8.617094,-3.772058,-0.06640037984560423,0.05158685267355634,1.0,0.10442616096025187,0.46140791027154654

There is really no limit to the kind of product you can work on, so as your passions go, so can your place in the company. Oversight at the middle management layer is really terrible. A manager is only as good as s/he chooses to be, and there is no real accountability for a manager being good or bad. To be clear, there are some employees who choose to be really great managers, and there are others who look at being a manager a personal career stepping stone and don't take their direct reports' careers seriously. What's more, many managers are individual contributors as well, so they have to look out for themselves as well as try to manage their team. Finally, many employees believe that being a manager is a step up the ladder, so that becomes an defining goal, but they may not develop the skills to be successful at it. I believe strongly that if Microsoft incentivized their managers to be great managers, the effectiveness of their direct reports would go up. 1) Tie manager rewards to the poll results. 2) Be consistent. This is a personal issue for me, but Microsoft made a big deal about adjusting the health benefits to reduce cost, yet they offer free soda to their employees. Free soda has no health benefits (the caffeine is pretty insignificant) and a pretty big health cost (it contributes to obesity). If you care about health cost, why give out something that may contribute to poorer health among your employees?

57732,microsoft,2014,"Opportunity to work with some amazing technologies and very smart people. Huge variety of work to choose from across a large organization. Life as a Senior engineer can be great with lots of interesting work and you can focus on engineering not meetings and politics. Lots of chances to interact with customers if you make time for it, even when its not part of your role. Microsoft has huge resources and can afford to invest heavily in research and development for the long term, there are only a few places you can work that are really able to do this. If you want to work on massive software projects that have a huge impact then Microsoft has a lot to offer.  Lots of opportunities to take on new challenges and learn new things provided your manager is supportive and your group is growing. There are some great managers at Microsoft and they make all the difference. Find a good one and work for them, follow them around if need be. Life at Microsoft is far better when someone has your back, especially at review time.  The salary and benefits package are still competitive but not as good as they were a few years back. Campus is being modernized and the working environment is good and getting better. For a large company the day-to-day work is pretty low friction in terms of needless rules, engineers have Admin access to their workstations etc. Big variability in culture and working conditions between groups. Some parts of the company are great places to work run by people who respect their reports and coworkers. Where people are encouraged to work as a team and do their best work. Other groups are perpetual death marches run by self-serving management. It's very hard to see the difference until after being hired. Once hired you are stuck in that position for 12-16 months. This is long enough to get a poor review which will make it harder to move.  Competitive culture encourages individuals to show themselves in the best light, even if it means making co-workers look bad or doing things that are not in the group or company's long term interests. The stack rank culture is engrained in the company, don't expect a different review system run by the same people who ran the old system to change things any time soon.  Decisions are often driven by politics and personalities. At the Principal level politics becomes more important. If you are the sort of person who says what they think, even if it is likely to be unpopular this may be your downfall. Being subsequently shown to be right will not help. The end result can be a a lot of smart people collectively making seemingly dumb decisions and building the wrong things. The Peter principle applies and often the politically savvy get promoted for all the wrong reasons. You come across quite a lot of senior people who are clearly just waiting to vest their next stock grants.  Over resourcing results in large teams and empire building. Often teams will vote to (re)build existing functionality ""we built our own DB because (we thought) SQL Server didn't meet our needs"". Lack of willingness to use open source and LCA's slow responses also promotes this problem. Sometimes this is due to valid IP taint issues but a lot of the time it's not. Smaller teams can often move faster because they are forced to make smarter decisions by their limited resources.  In general Microsoft has been slow to adopt the latest engineering practices. There are good reasons for this on some of their largest products, like SQL and Windows, but in many other cases it is simply a case of ""not invented here"" and ""we're Microsoft, we're different"". The fight to get newer (agile) process and engineering practices adopted on several of my teams was a long and painful one. If you want to work on smaller projects using the latest practices then choose your team carefully. Ditch the old culture, it is no longer attracting the best people and in today's (hot) job market new hires and current employees have a lot of other options. There's a noticeable exodus to other employers (management knows this but do not seem to stem the tide). Overall the company is very inward looking, most employees have a very skewed view of the rest of the technology landscape. This skewed vision drives product decisions and fails to delight customers.  Decide on the company's direction and stick with it.

If you aren't moving up, you're moving out. Collaboration is encouraged, but absolutely not rewarded due to the review system. I know they have recently stopped the stack ranking process, but the culture around it has been in place for decades and will not be easy to change.  Also, because of this culture of ""me first"", and a history/culture centered on technology/code to solve problems, Microsoft doesn't really care or know how to care about its customers. They have top-notch researchers with PhDs who don't know how and don't have the time to conduct proper user research. The few that do aren't valued. As a result, the focus is on features, code and getting promotions, not understanding real-world customer needs and collaborating as a team to solve them. I found this frustrating and prevented me from getting excited about the projects on which I worked because I knew they weren't going to really help solve the users' problems. Interestingly, management seems to know that they have a cultural problem and they want to change it, they just aren't sure how. This is at least a promising sign that Microsoft has the potential to turn itself around and realize its full potential. My advice would be to focus on understanding customers' needs and wants. Invest in user research, specifically ethnography and social anthropology studies, not surveys, site visits and usability studies (although they have their place as well). Next, do whatever it takes to build a culture that rewards collaboration rather than stifling it. I truly wish you all the best of luck. If Microsoft can address these two issues, I believe their potential will be amazing.

The environment is extremely competitive, and if you're not a task-oriented go-getter, it can be hard to shine, even if innovating is the company's new focus. There are also cases when young employees, in their new high-responsibility roles, might let the power get to their head a little. However, managers do make an effort to counter this self-centered behavior. Continue to stress the importance of improving the whole rather than improving the self. Also, informal check-ins can sometimes be more helpful than formal check-ins, as these tend to raise the stakes and make it harder to bring up seemingly small issues.",-7.7513256,11.8412,-0.03573911656050256,-0.025474532846647382,5.0,0.18366161616161616,0.5336868686868688

Giving programs, health benefits, fitness incentives, continuing education, structured career conversations -- lots of things point to the company taking a genuine interest in your personal and professional well being (of course not without its own motives).  - Lots of room for growth at the lower levels, things start to become bottle-necked around the ""Manager of managers"" level  - Company is constantly reinventing itself. It can be a dinosaur in many ways (especially legacy code bases and antiquated engineering styles), but everyday we get closer to modernizing the entire company from the bottom up. This can also be a source of frustration, but is much more exciting.  - Product portfolio is second to none. This is the only company in the world where I can work on a PC OS, tablet hardware, machine learning algorithm, design a popular coding language, work on embedded technology, build a productivity suite, develop a game console -- and still be under the same corporate roof with no relocation necessary. - Company at times doesn't appear designed to retain top-tier talent. Elimination of the stack system, while widely praised, wasn't replaced by any incentives for the top 5% to stay. This is a symptom of a company which, while inventing itself in many ways, can still at times be a monolithic bureaucracy  - Product group and corporate culture can be Russian Roulette. There are teams at the company working on breakthrough products filled to the brim with absolute rockstars. There are other teams working on maintaining antiquated contractually ordained technology with people who reek of sadness and despair. Thankfully horizontal mobility is super common at the company, so if you get dealt a bad hand you're not locked in forever. Continue to invest in programs which communicate genuine care for employees. As we push into retail, things like corporate discounts and ""VIP"" programs give a sense of preferential treatment which translates into corporate pride. Remodeling the cafeterias on campus is a great initiative and should continue. Continue to brand the campus. Everyday Microsoft employees face a public community which has stopped believing we can innovate -- we've become the underdog. Some extra-ordinary thinking is called for to make sure employees feel a sense of belongingness and pride, two things that help motivate and excite.  Additionally, invest in ""fast-track"" programs for those who exhibit top tier talent. Previously being ranked in that top tier equated to additional compensation, which helped offset the sometimes artificially stagnant promotion cadence. In the brave new world there needs to exist programs which communicate loud and clear why staying with Microsoft is in the best interests of one's career.

The people are top notch - if you enjoy working with smart talented people, Microsoft is a great place to be.  Promotions are frequent thru the IC ranks - but as with any role, gets more challenging as you start managing people. The Director/Principle levels are particularly congested - expect it to be hyper competitive.  Benefits are strong and progressive - competitive with any company in the industry. As you earn tenure in the company, vacation time increases substantially, up to 5 weeks off/year as a US employee (other geos vary)  Finally, in terms of career opportunities, the great thing about Microsoft is it's diversity of businesses. From consumer to enterprise, Cloud to embedded software - there are a plethora of opportunities and no shortage of interesting roles. Though the culture is changing (and hopefully, with a new CEO, it will accelerate), the company still relies too heavily on individual heroics. The previous stack rank review system encourage a behavior that was very much individualist.  There is also a ton of complexity in the processes of the company - a necessary evil in any large organization. This complexity forces too much time to be expended on internal issues as opposed to focusing on driving the business, seeking new opportunities.  Finally, the company has a tendency to elect ""direct"" strategies in key growth areas. Whether it is getting into the phone business by buying a handset vendor or building our own search engine - Microsoft needs to focus and bet on more disruptive strategy plays, changing the rules of the game like many newcomers have done in the last decade. Don't just reward good performance, reward on innovation that is not par for the course - but has the potential to be a real disruptive force in the market.

HR's idiotic and stifling stack ranking (or curve fitting) of employees is now _supposedly_ gone (as part of the ""One Microsoft"" reorganization). I fear the bureaucratic and myopic HR remains It will take years for HR's poison to be cleaned out of Microsoft. Due to stack ranking, there are now thousands of technically shallow and dispassionate managers tucked away.  I must wonder whether HR employees were held responsible for their years of employee abuse (it appears not). Over the years, HR trained MS employees well: You were to climb on the backs of your fellow employees, you must avoid working with those who are ""better"", you were to work according to the metrics your manager imposed (which were frequently idiotic ones, not much better than a ""lines of code"" metric), and you were to transfer anywhere else, as quickly as possible (so that you stay 'fresh', in your manager's eye).  Prior to the reorg, the head of Sales & Support required Sales training upon all, required no Support training, and completely misunderstood the purpose of Support (he apparently thought Support was suppose to make sales pitches). With Sales and Support now supposedly split up (per ""One Microsoft""), perhaps such damaging behavior has been limited to just ""one"" of the many Microsoft divisions.. HR needs to be quartered. The money spent on glossy HR brochures and over-produced internal sales videos should be replaced with more morale events. Contracting and outsourcing need to be quartered - think more about employee & customer loyalty, and less about your stock holders' short term bottom line.  Show and advertise to each country that you care about it, by ensuring each country is only supported by its citizens. Recognize individual employees by offering individual bonuses - ones that are not tied to any of the many ""One Microsoft"" performance metrics. Remember what Mark Twain wrote about statistics/metrics.  Reduce the deepest levels of management by 50%. Foster more employee & customer feedback, through _fewer_ levels of management. Start listening more to the _variety_ of your customers. Recognize your marketS: What what youths want is not going to align with what a CIO wants, and individually tailor solutions. Remember that Windows started personal (and _then_ went corporate). Avoid the ""one Microsoft size fits all Microsoft customers"" gutter (e.g. Windows 8).  Acknowledge by actions when (individual and) team metrics are not perfect, - e.g. selectively override some of the lower bonuses when they are due to one year's poor ""metrics"". Be far more terse in your emails: The higher up in Microsoft management one is, the longer the emails have been, but your employees become spammed (each manger is trying to outdo another in email length), jaded, or overwhelmed.",-13.317371,-3.6949887,-0.10858080917483019,0.06366713410399057,2.0,0.06980004122861268,0.46938260152545874

Managers that are struggling to meet some of their business KPIs will make sure they meet their ""diversity"" KPI so they will hire and promote certain people just to hit that target. So when the business is not doing well the system makes managers promote people for their race or gender, not their performance. The GFC wasn't a major issue in APAC but things did slow in some areas and there were plenty of under-qualified people getting jobs and recognition that shouldn't have. I was told point blank ""I would love to consider you for xxx role but I wouldn't be able to have a white male in the job. I have to hire an Asian female."" That was from a VERY senior exec (ie: partner level) and he/she didn't bat an eyelid when he/she said it. I was gobsmacked! Surprisingly it makes it very hard for the solid performers rise to the top because they are often trodden on by climbers who take credit for work that is not theirs or get discredited by others who are looking for scapegoats.
