4465,google,2011,"The following is related to sales operations management. You'll work with very smart people, and get a lot of support and feedback around doing your best work. Most senior managers have great knowledge, a lot of advice to offer, and value open, transparent communication. You'll likely work the hardest you've ever worked at Google, but you'll also be greatly rewarded. Also, Google makes it very easy to work your hardest, and that's a huge bonus if you're interested in super-charging your career. Example (day in the life): take free shuttle to work, use available corp vehicles to run daytime errands, grab a hand brewed coffee and gourmet breakfast before starting work, communicate with brightest in your industry during the day, visit a tech-talk and learn something new, workout in the gym w/ a trainer before lunch, have lunch with a colleague at 1 of >15 free themed cafes, grab an espresso shot from the micro-kitchen on way to your desk, collaborate on a new project with someone in a different working group, back to your own work, quick $5 chair massage to rejuvenate, swing by tech-stop on way to grab a new mouse, before your professional desk ergonomic consultation begins, more work, grab gourmet dinner starting at 6:30, woah, it's late - time to go home, grab late (8:30) shuttle home. (I guess i'll have to do my laundry for free at work tomorrow). Google is changing, and it's experiencing some growing pains. There are new projects and focus areas every week, and the grouping of functions and teams changes constantly. As a result, managers are responsible to new macro functional groups, and new projects or focus areas every month or so. This seems an unnecessary distraction, amounting to 25% superfluous work. The change in org structure has made it hard to maintain the career path of your choice. Instead, you must choose from available Google-centric career paths. These are not always (or often) composed of conventional roles, since Google is both changing rapidly, and unconventional to begin with. Most of the people hired at Google 5+ years ago, don't have the credentials to be hired there today. This complicates internal transfers, even though HR attempts to solve that issue. Those joining Google from acquisitions are rarely hirable at Google in any other way, yet their experience and contributions once onboard are typically at par. This again complicates the internal transfer process. Be more accommodating to veteran Googlers. The company is changing very fast, and they need active guidance to navigate successfully. Active - not reactive. Be more direct when providing guidance and mentoring to all managers and direct reports. Google is getting a bit too ""careful"", and I've found that more managers these days are reluctant to tell it like it is, for fear of appearing undiplomatic. Diplomacy and tact should make a manager a better communicator, not a constrained one.",-10.157347,-1.493352,-0.04991366573621317,0.03986423053047546,4.0,0.1874647776465959,0.5145478158205431

It ensures most of the time we are all going in roughly the same direction, even if no one seems to have the time to verify it's the right direction  If a mistake is made, large or small, it's acknowledged, fixed, and people move on.  There is an honest believe that if there is a right way to do something, it will be done that way, even if it's a huge amount of effort initially.  You can depend on the fact that when you work with someone, they aren't an idiot, so any disagreement can be resolved sensibly.  Every company gets the odd manager who is not suited for their position occasionally. In Google, anyone can report a problem, so a manager gets help or a more suitable role. The rate of change can upset people, nothing is constant. If you think you are making progress on your project, it's time to receive an email about deprecating an old database API or requiring every product to integrate the latest greatest security technology.  Because the company has shown it can completely change direction very quickly, many people desire such changes, even when they may not be needed.

Sideways mobility between software engineering groups. The scale of its operations are amazing. For its size, it is still one of the best companies to work for. It is very well run. Perks. A culture that doesn't prohibit fun, and in some sense encourages it. Long hours: It depends on the individual, but it's easy to feel that you need to produce more and ending up selling yourself short. The work involves a lot of time wasting ""archaeology"" - sifting through wikis, code labs and other people's code figuring out what is the latest recommended way to do something that sounds boiler-plate and obvious, so it's easy to feel unproductive at times. Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there.  Hard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by. I feel that most joining now are likely to end up being just a number: average (in Google standards) impact and zero visibility, irrespective of how much of a rock star they were in their previous jobs.  It's becoming more and more the target of lawsuits, which basically means that legal fees will continue to cut a larger share of its revenues. In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I'm not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will.  I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career.

24651,amazon,2011,"FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION: Amazon does a good job communicating at the employee level. At many large comanies, the sheer size of the company means things slow down. Amazon does a great job focusing on communication tools to ensure information is disciminated as needed. Use of email, OCS, IRC, multiple ticking systems, and ancilary tools to find people help ensure information can get to where it needs to be now.  OWNERSHIP OF TASKS: Each department has authority to do what it needs to do without excessive input from management. Even during major issues, regular employees can make the call to execute large scale solutions without having to go to management for approval. Teams themselves own day to day tasks and are responsible for them, often operating as a small business within the company . This allows each team to support their internal customers quickly with out office politics and meddling by multiple levels of management.  LEARNING ABILITY: There is so much to do that after 1 or 2 years in a position, you are encouraged to move to another department if you so desire. This allows you to take your current skills, build on them, and grow into a new job. However, if you decide to stay put, technology changes so rapidly that you'll be constantly learning new programming skills, new operating systems, and new tools.  MANAGEMENT OF POOR PERFORMERS: Up or out. It's that simple. Not performing, improve or you're gone. Poor performers cannot hide and are not tolerated. Managers have to fight for their employees every year and explain why everyone is valuable and should stay. If you don't perform, you'll be at the bottom of the pool and looking for your next job.  KNOWLEDGEABLE CO-WORKERS: Although Amazon does not focus on education but multiple factors in hiring, it seems as if most people have advanced degrees. Not just that, but everyone is a super-star. If you think you know all there is to know about your job and are the top person in your company, Amazon will show you there are plenty of people better than you. That provides the drive for employees to learn, grow, and improve.  FOCUS ON EMPLOYEES: Of course, this depends on the department as well. But, most departments do a great job of focusing on employees. Many jobs can be stressful and hectic at times. But, management takes care of their employees. Some teams have a cereal breakfast bar available every day, a Friday afternoon happy hour with food, beer, and wine (yes, in the office!), and quarterly fun events / outings. This is in addition to the Director or VP walking the cubes just to pop in and say hi and see how things are going. DRIVE TO PERFORM: There is a constant drive to perform and produce. What you did last year or last month no longer matters. What benefit will you contribute to the company this week? If your answer is ""I want to sit back and relax"", this isn't the place for you. The drive to perform can be overwhelming for some as it requires constant work and improvement.  POOR DOCUMENTATION: Amazon is a software company that moves fast. Documentation is an after thought. That causes problems when you don't understand something. Granted, there are internal help documents that any employee can create or update, but that doesn't get done regularly. You'll have to have a keen eye at understanding that a document from 4 years ago that contrasts a document from another department from 2 years ago may be 1/4 right and the new document 1/4 wrong. And, I guarantee once you figure it out, you probably won't go back and update the documentation for the next guy.  A LITTLE TO FAST PACED: Things happen so rapidly that it is sometimes counter productive. That software you just wrote or the fix you are being asked to do may only be in production for 2 months. Then you'll have to completely rewrite it. Amazon uses the excuse of the sheer size of operations to justify projects that only have a life span of a couple of months.  ONCALL: Not use to on-call? Get use to it. No matter who you are you WILL be on-call at sometime. Some teams make it easier by having a ""follow the sun"" approach (you might be on for 12 hours during the day and someone in India on for 12 hours during your night time).

Example suppose you receive 30K in signing bonuses and relocation expenses, and you decide to leave or are let go before your 24 months is up. Amazon pre-deducts the taxes for your bonuses up front, so you may only actually get a check for 20K and the other 10K goes to the government. If you leave after the tax cycle ends, then Amazon will want back their full 30K and you will have to figure out how to get the rest back from the IRS on your own. Also, even if you pay them the full 30K there is a very high degree of possibility that they will not send you an updated W2 and will hope you just let them keep the 10K tax free.

If he only was even 1/10th as smart in managing people and culture this would be a great place The list will be long and read like many others... First and foremost, the core truth is that this company cares nothing for any employee without SVP or higher in their title... You are a replaceable part in the machine, and you will be told so. With the current market and their rising stock - it is true... there are lines of people waiting to work here and put this on their resume. You should be prepared to have a 2 year absence of a life outside work and be aware of that being the cost for putting this on your resume. Second, what isn't fully clear until you see the review process is that you will actually be penalized for the stock doing well. They have a target for what you should be paid (and it's not at the top of the market :)) and if the stock appreciates more now, you will simply receive less in the future. If this stock ever has a significant falloff half the people working here will be gone the next day. Third, micro-management is extreme - (from VP/SVP on down). You will be measured on taking ownership, but not ever truly allowed to have it. You will own any of the mistakes from your management chain on down - your management (director up) will own the success. If you come to work here you will learn things - some about technical skills, solving big problems - some about how not to run a company populated by human beings, but make sure you have a long term plan to leave before you start - as the compensation and value will start to rapidly diminish after 2 years. I will give some - but I think the way the company is is EXACTLY as the senior management want it to be. They are too smart to have this situation be by anything but design. They want to bring in new blood, drain it dry, and then throw out the husks every few years - that is their management plan.  But, my advice would be to be careful about the ongoing top/bottom grading process, as you are starting to reach a point where the negative perceptions are hurting the ability to hire... you are 'raising the bar' with people who actually lower it and the long term future of the ability to compete in the tech sector is diminishing with this.",-8.693057,0.6449823,-0.04316507554581461,0.023171817588500395,2.0,0.12238485081227017,0.40327293674067877

24786,amazon,2011,"Some of the smartest people in the technology and retail world work at Amazon. That being said, every day becomes a learning opportunity. For someone early in their career (less than 5-6 years of work experience), it's truly a great place to work. Amazon is unique in that it's a pretty small company that manages to accomplish a lot. That means leaner teams and everyone becomes experts in multiple areas. As a ""stepping stone"" job, it's a good place to learn new skills (especially in the project management arena) that can lead to bigger and better things.  I became a new dog owner when I was working there, so to be able to bring my dog into the office was a huge plus. Granted there are rules and restrictions (especially in certain buildings on the new campus), but I still thought that was pretty cool. It's no secret that compensation is a major pain point of working at Amazon. While HR claims that compensation is ""industry average"", it takes into account salary, benefits and stock. The restricted stock units take at least 3-5 years to vest, so unless you stay for that long, you're not really getting industry average. Benefits are run of the mill, nothing special and no real perks.  Amazon is also famously known for its high turnover. I remember on my first day at the new employee training, someone told me that the average person doesn't stay for more than 18 months. I now understand why (especially since I left exactly at the 18 month mark). Amazon works their employees hard (see aforementioned lean teams) and they're pretty nonapologetic for it. The feeling you get is that you should be lucky that you get to work there. Seeing as it is an extremely successful and highly respected corporation, I get it. But at the same time, it can be incredibly frustrating. The lean teams means that promotions and movement from team to team is challenging. While the level of job flexibility (timings, working from home, etc.) differs from department to department, it tends to be pretty rigid. There are a lot of new products and services being worked on outside of the core retail and Kindle businesses, but the teams working on those products are treated like the red-headed stepchildren of Amazon. Turnover tends to be higher in those teams and unless there is some sort of overarching cohesion between the businesses and Amazon's corporate strategy, turnover will continue to be high.",-5.6039,-4.130386,-0.027126234910019423,0.02530646109932746,4.0,0.15692370129870128,0.546906843156843

The insurance is really good and you have a 401K. Amazon really is customer centric,to a fault. My FC got AC for the summer! Working hard is a Pro and a Con. The bad side is the harder you work, the more they expect. They take everything you have and you do not get a whole lot back. Sometimes your reward for working hard is mandatory overtime. Over the last year, our perks have changed for the worse. We used to get $10 and $20 Amazon gift cards, and last peak that turned into $5 gas cards. When I found this out it was pretty discouraging. As much as this company makes you would think that the perks would be getting better, not worse! We just had a rate increase for my department, which is no big deal, but there was no compensation for it. As far as work/life balance, that is still pretty bad. For associates it's not near as bad as managers, as Amazon will suck your life away. As I said in the Pros, Amazon is customer centric to a fault.

Same time, you will learn a great deal and will understands IT end-to-end.  For an SDE, being a part of Amazon Web Services gives you the edge to work on truly high-scale projects and buys you a free ticket to many other work places when you decide to leave. Interestingly enough, right now there is an exodus of Microsoft people willing to switch over and work for AWS.  Amazon is definitely not for everyone and requires a lot of effort to stay sane. Yes, you will be stressed out almost every day: either being on-call fixing stuff you never seen before (the timer is ticking btw) or managing unrealistic project deadlines or very often both in parallel. However you may look at it from another angle -- this is how people bond and develop trust when they go through hell together. Your Amazon co-workers will be like your good old army friends forever.  On-call can be horrible depending on the team or time of the year but don't create illusions because the industry is shifting the majority of software jobs towards developing and running services. Amazon will take you ahead on that and you will learn how it's done on the large scale. As a matter of fact, at Microsoft more and more devs carrying a pager too and also staying sleepless (yeah a bit to the East, in Redmond.)  I like the fact that people don't slack around here and majority of managers are occupied with a plenty of real issues and getting paged too. There is very little of bureaucracy here: know the right thing to do? then go and just do it! You will feel empowered when you realize that you control such a huge fleet. You will find a lot of smart people around you and most of the time they say what they mean.  After tasting Amazon it is hard to go back to the traditional IT company where everything is slow and managers are afraid of changes. If you prefer true ownership of what you are given, you will find Amazon a decent company to work for. The attrition is very high which is not good for the moral but again those people who are leaving now will call you some day with a job offer.  Agree with other reviews that you should know a lot of stuff before joining Amazon because there is no time to learn or take a class on anything. It is a sink-or-swim environment. Taking this into account, I would say that entering Amazon is probably better as the second job when you already know quite a few things, learned to code well, understand how to manage priorities, and now it's time to turn your brain on full throttle.  Amazon has the worst choice of medical plans across pretty much all high-tech non-startup companies in the area and I don't count MS at all here.  Honestly, I do not recommend Amazon to my friends because it is not a comfortable place to work at.

24833,amazon,2011,"Amazon pays better than other tech companies, such as Google or Microsoft. Signing bonuses of $50k are common for mid-level positions, and up to $100k signing bonuses occur with regularity. It’s usual half in cash, half in stock grants. The cash is over two years, the stock over four. As opposed to most other tech companies, Amazon is a low cost RETAILER. Amazon teams are notoriously short staffed, from high turnover and from intentionally lean budgets. Be prepared to work 80+ hours a week, flat out, week after week. It’s common to work weekends, and overnight. With the rapid fire pace, Amazonians are always taking shortcuts. That means crappy initial code, poor QA and no documentation (isn’t a good thing when you have high turnover). I can’t understate how intense, stressful and unbalanced the work-life is here.  Amazon offers none of the extravagant benefits that other tech companies do. You get health insurance, and that’s about it. (there are annual stock grants tied to your review performance, but most consider this to be part of your wage compensation). Oh, and you get a total of $100 off of Amazon sold products per year. Yippie!  In addition to lacking any balance, the environment is highly politically and hierarchy-based, and filled with newbie tech managers, many of whom have no managerial skills or experience (remember the high turnover).  By running the company with an anemically lean staff, paying no benefits and squeezing every bit of life out of their employees, Amazon saves money… a lot of money. So much so, that they can throw a little of it back in the form of industry leading pay rates (if you negotiate for it). But don’t be fooled by the carrot, once you a lured in, you’ll get hit with the stick. Take a cue from Google, Microsoft and other and significantly improve the horrible work-life balance at the company.

24834,amazon,2011,"- Good sign-on bonus and initial stock awards - Opportunity to work with very large distributed systems (at uncommon scale) - Working for Amazon Web Services looks good on the resume - Opportunity to get better at operations and how to debug and fix issues more efficiently (although sometimes under a lot of pressure) - Learn development from end to end (design to deployment to operations) - Dynamic: depending on the team, you will have the feeling of being in a startup but without worrying about having money for your project. - You do some development, but you are not a software developer. The title ""software development engineer"" is misleading and this is the first thing to be aware of when considering Amazon as employer. You may develop, but the vast majority of people spend most of their time doing other things, like fixing issues, testing, documenting, trying to plan the project, handling bureaucracy, adapting existing code, and doing some program and project manager work. After a few years at the company, I would say that I may have actually coded 10% of the time. You are more of a ""software engineer"", if this breadth of experience attracts you, but few will be technical experts that develop a lot.  - Operation burden: there are teams that suffer with a lot of operation and the vast majority of developers need to be on-call – yes, you will be tied to a pager. The problem is that pager duty are usually 24 hours for 7 days and there is little to no respect from management about people that has to work around the clock. Don’t expect to have follow-the-sun model or any other arrangements unless things are very ugly (particularly true for AWS). Just to give you some numbers, there are teams that get paged more than once every hour of the day (yes, 25+ pages a day). You are expected to be online in a few minutes, so don't think that running a quick errand while on-call is a good idea if you are on such a team.  - Long hours: examples are better than just saying things here. These were rewarded in AWS' all-hands meetings: a developer who called in to help debugging a ticket during his daughter's wedding and another developer that was working while his wife's baby delivery. This is the message that is sent and the bar is set so high about the dedication that, if you try to meet it, your life will be your work. Many do, especially if they are young. Some seem even think it’s worth the effort.  - Long-term compensation: Amazon typically offers good sign-on bonuses and initial stock awards, but what is not said is that these bonuses and awards are going to be used in the following years not to give you any additional bonuses (manager’s talk is ""including your shares and sign-on bonus, your compensation this year is pretty good, so I can't give you anything else""). There isn't cash bonus during performance review and, when managers give you stock awards, they are much lower than your initial stock awards.  - Short-sighted: although Jeff Bezos is visionary, Amazon is still not a technology company and all development is target at the near future and how much revenue it will bring. Some AWS platforms would require much long term investment and vision to be more reliable or develop the in-house expertise, but they are often rushed for the business sake, which affects a lot of technical decisions. Although backed by a multi-billion business, Amazon is still not the company that will invest a few years into an effort without seeing the dollar value of that venture.  - Lack of QA teams: since it's short-sighted, QA is very much below what one would expect for such large company with such systems - especially if we are talking about infrastructure for so many other companies, like AWS is. It's not uncommon to see tens of SDEs without a single person dedicated to testing (QA engineer, SDETs).  - No learning/training on the job: do not expect to have much chance of learning on the job. You must do it on your own if you want your career to progress.  - Career progression: your chances of career progression vary substantially depending on the business. Retail, AWS, and Digital are very different in terms of promotion and, depending on your group, the bar may be so high that it seems impossible to meet it in practice. That opens up a lot of opportunities for politics to take place. You may be stuck in your position for many and many years – do not be surprised to see competent people being SDE II for 10+ years, without prospects of any advancement. Also bear in mind that, although you can transfer internally, in practice that resets your history, so you better put up with your current team and do what your manager wants if you want to have any chance of being promoted.  - Benefits/Frugality: they are OK, but nothing compared to other companies. You will have 6 paid holidays – no day after Thanksgiving for you, for instance. You will have to pay for your coffee at the company meeting. Good, but not the best hardware for your development – it’s not uncommon to see people paying out of their pockets for keyboard, more memory, better chair, and sometimes even buying or bringing monitors from home. Depending on the org, you will be able to expense books, but oftentimes it will be so much work to get your manager’s approval (including proving that it’s work related) that will not be worth all the effort. Team lunch? Be prepared to chip in as team events are rare and, not uncommon, your manager’s budget will not cover it all.

I worked at Amazon for over 5 years. I put in on avg about 60 hours per week, which is typical for most employees. Work/life balance doesn't exist and you are expected to be available at all hours of the day. I got a call from my boss at 2am once (everything is a fire drill). I would be more understanding if they instilled a sense of appreciation for their employees, but they don't. Lots of work with very little praise. You get tons of criticism though. It's also a very political environment due to their ""Top Grading"" process. They have to let go 10% of their employees annually and managers are often forced to down grade reviews to meet this curve (this is literally a company goal that all SVPs are held accountable to). I've seen it happen multiple times with out just cause. They've relocated people from all over the world and then a year later fired them. Very little respect for people and their families.  I know I sound like a bitter employee, but I'm really not (I actually left on very good terms). I just want people to know what they are getting themselves into before they do it. If you are thinking about relocating for this company, don't do it. It's too risky (especially if you have a family).

24875,amazon,2011,"Pay is above average. There are more good people at Amazon than what I'm reading here. Fairly autonomous environment. Good benefits. Once again, so many to list. But basically this place is the very definition of cogs in a machine. As someone who works on the floor whether you receive, stock, pick, ship, etc the only thing that matter are your numbers. NUMBERS NUMBERS NUMBERS. That is the most often emphasized theme there. It is their mantra for goodness sake. Low end employees while I worked there weren't really mistreated but largely ignored unless you had a problem. I think Amazon is really working on improving the workplace atmosphere. Because Whitestown was not nearly as bad as others are describing. But people randomly walk around and check in with you on your numbers and if they aren't up to par you will be gently encouraged for a limited time until you are basically fired but complimented for your contribution. The pace there is outrageous. There are some positions where some people can simply just not keep up. So if you work there you can make it work but be careful to choose the right position for you.  I found that our direct management was actually pretty decent. They would encourage you to come with them for issues but the problem is they would just repeatedly fix issues and not fix the root cause. And by extension creating more down time and frustration for the employee who's numbers are dropping while they fix their scanner or some other repetitive issue. Whenever you address an issue that clearly exists that needs remedied on a larger scale to prevent other future issues middle management shrugs their shoulders and just says oh well. And I have a distinct feeling that upper management probably doesn't care what the underlings say. I find this indifference and ignorance odd since the whole company's mission statement is based on efficiency.  There definitely are some bad managers who just need a whip and they'd crack it. Although surprisingly I would say that was the exception more than the rule at this particular facility. Be that as it may just more transparency and more respect for people who are obviously smarter than the rest of the work force would be nice. There are plenty of people who are happy to just work their butts off and go unnoticed but if your someone who can figure out things on a larger scale and structure and see the inefficiencies or issues you will be very frustrated not only by realizing these things, but peoples indifference to their existence.  Then of course finally, work/life balance. I won't go on about it. But it is literally once of the worst place to work in regards to that. You may be a worthless drone to them but dangit you're THEIR worthless drone. But most people go in expecting that as well. So just be prepared. MORE TRANSPARENCY! Actually strive to recognize the issues brought to you by lower management and other employees and seek to correct them. Make sure those in management have some level of people skills and make sure they understand the very company they work for. If one of their lower employees can figure things out and they can't, that's a bad sign. HIRE MORE PEOPLE! You definitely have the deep pockets to hire more people. During off season or normal season maybe not as required. But when it is peak or busier just hire enough people to balance the load so people don't have to work at insane paces in tandem with insane hours. This is not China and this is not a sweatshop. Show a little respect and gratitude and stop it with insulting rewards system you throw around for free vending items or the slim chance of winning prizes during peak season. I guarantee most people find this marginally motivating.",0.7502324,-6.717922,-0.010799604500156004,0.067295469169435,2.0,0.055417955060812214,0.5470686456400741

And worse is that they take pride in being chaotic, and continue to work in that fashion. IMO, it leads to huge wastage of resources(mental and others), repetition of work, and unnecessary confusion.  - Average compensation for a heavy work load  - Bluff sells.  - You can end up in a project without having a clear project definition, scope and resource set!

This means that you will find yourself doing obscure SQL queries and making giant spreadsheets that don't add value--but are a part of the job. This makes some of the more interesting analysis-focused jobs more about cleansing metrics instead of analyzing them This is a difficult question: on the one hand the company is very political, lacks processes, and often times seems like a sweatshop for intellectuals, at the same time, the company has weathered the recession without any major layoffs, continues to grow, and actually focuses on the long-term. If you asked me when I started, the first thing I would suggest is that the company add more structure, after leaving you realize that part of the reason the company has done so well is the constant pressure to perform.

33841,amazon,2011,"* Compensation - Overall compensation, if drawn out over four years and averaged per year, is above average - especially if the stock performs well. If you get an offer and do the math, this will seem like a small fortune. The medical benefits are quite good compared to other companies, my premiums were very low.  * Reputation - When you leave Amazon, you will find that having worked there carries weight with other companies due to its success and reputation for only hiring the best (true or not, perception is reality).  * Opportunities to move - If you like to move every year or two, Amazon is expanding rapidly and always asking for current managers to move.  * Business - Amazon is expanding rapidly in order to accommodate growing demand. You will not be downsized or laid off. * Compensation - Yes, this is also a con. Specifically, the compensation is not adequate given the sacrifices you will make. As an Area Manager, you will routinely (off-peak) put in 50 hour weeks. Additionally, you may be working nights with no differential (your pay is the same). Due to Amazon's growth, mandatory overtime will be called frequently during off-peak season and you will be doing over 60 hours those weeks (you receive no overtime - you are exempt from labor laws). During peak (defined as November and December) you will put in 60 - 70 hours each week. Start doing the math and the pay per hour worked falls below acceptable levels. * Working Conditions - Here's a shout-out to all of those working in FCs not in Phoenix (where they have air conditioning). During the summer months, the FC’s heat index remains above 100 day and night. It is not uncommon to be asking associates to meet their productivity goals while the heat index is at 110. Your pickers or stowers will be drenched in sweat looking like they are about to be a heat casualty. They get five extra minutes for break - that is all. You WILL feel like you are running a third-world sweatshop. * Advancement - If you do not have an MBA and are not in the Pathways program than you are a second-class manager. Pathways do not work nights, and they will automatically promote regardless of performance. This is a fact, not an opinion. I have worked with some excellent Pathways managers, and I have worked with some absolutely dreadful ones. The bad ones are not fired, but instead moved around to allow them to fail in a different area. If you do not ""drink the kool-aid"" you will be labeled as ""negative"". Senior leaders do not want to be challenged or questioned. Do not approach them with your concerns and do not attempt to be an advocate for the associates under your care. You will quietly be ignored and not considered for any promotion above the AM level even if your performance reviews and associate surveys are excellent. * Work/Life Balance - This is hit hard in just about every Amazon review on the site. See the above compensation con for hours worked. Also realize that you will very likely end up working nights. If you have a family, this will be incredibly disruptive as you will be on an opposite schedule even on your days off. There is not set rotation off of night shift. You can ask, but there is no guarantee and I have worked with AMs that have spent four years and counting on nights even though they have a family and have been requesting days since their first year. If you are single, this may not be a big deal. Also realize that you will be working weekends, either a Saturday or a Sunday. If your kids are in school, you only have one day a week to spend time with them. * Your real job – As an AM for a large shift, you are being hired to babysit. You will spend a vast majority of your time issuing documented warnings to your associates that are underperforming. When they make an error, you will go find them slap their wrist. When they are off-task for a few minutes, you will go find them. You may have 50 – 100 associates and you are going to spend your time making sure they stay on task and follow procedures. You will focus on the negative all of the time because that is the nature of working in an Amazon FC where numbers are king. You will gain plenty of experience dealing with people. But you will not learn any technical or in depth operations skills. Actual operations decisions will be made in meetings without your input. Hiring and even firings of your direct reports will often be made without your input and sometimes knowledge, thus exacerbating the feeling that you were hired only to babysit, not run an operation. *If you remain in the Reserves – Lastly, for you JMOs coming off of active duty that are staying in the reserves, it can be difficult to work at Amazon while actively drilling. If you are working nights, have fun staying up all day during your weekend drills (your body will be on a reverse cycle). Since your shift includes a weekend, you will need to apply for military LOA. Amazon will freely grant this. However, they will cut your paycheck. I found it humorous that during peak when I was working 70+ hours a week, my paystub would still calculate 40 hours per week in order to keep the pay consistent (remember, you are exempt and do not receive overtime). The second you actually miss a day for training, your pay is cut by 10 hours – so now they start counting hours. It’s not against the law, but I just found it less than favorable. My current position (and the one prior to Amazon) both assumed I would make up any work missed and not miss any deadlines- that is the nature of an exempt position. Amazon lives up to its philosophy – customers come first. Start with the customer and work your way back and who is on the tail end? The associates, and they know it. Take a cue from a business you own (Zappos) and try working that from the other end. The labor market will improve one day and Amazon will find itself unable to hire quality managers and associates as their reputation will begin to erode any goodwill from the labor pool.",-1.6493859,-23.293516,-0.048552720795085075,0.07569587750174721,2.0,0.03276324614352784,0.42953163424994417

33889,amazon,2011,I actually really enjoyed working as a Customer Service Manager. The people are great and the amount of empowerment was huge. The ability to make changes and better the work environmet is so much fun. Management actually listens and it is great to see that change is embraced. The work life balance is lacking. It is expected that you will work in the evenings on your lap top from home & weekends. I also do not like the forced ranking system that they have in place for employee evaluations. Even if those that you work with are mostly great everyone is forced ranked and pay raises are given based on that ranking. so basically you work your ass off and then may still be in the middle of the pack....especially because the bar is constntly raising.

Opportunity to advance and stay challenged for a call-center environment is above average...catch 22 of this is listed below. In this company, what you know and who you know go hand in hand. Floor management is given independence to run their teams their way, provided they hit goals and don't draw too far outside the lines. This in some ways creates a public school environment: Some teachers inspire their students...some make them want to drop out entirely. From the top down there is a constant but rather inconsistent level of pressure to perform or face termination. When there is a lull in customer volume, employees are given adequate time and support to develop their skills...if the volume spikes unexpectedly however, external pressure related to the bottom line overrules, and suddenly everyone in the center is under the guillotine again. As an employee that has seen 80% of the center (now 900 strong) replaced with fresh meat in only a years time, and a large number of those let go having equal or better performance than my own (networking is key), it is frustrating to see so much talent go to waste on a regular basis as a result of a supervisor's<team manger's<director's<corp exec's own stress to perform-or-face-a-similar-fate mentality. Going back to the Pros, you can advance rapidly if you make people notice the positive things you do at the right time, because every level in the hierarchy drops like flies. SLOW DOWN and don't lose your center! When you have potential competitors with pocketbooks 1000x the size I realize this is difficult, but it is not a positive position to be in from an internal culture standpoint.

A number of smart people get hired. 5. The industry is growing very fast. 6. Well known brand with instant street recognition. 7. Facilities are pretty good. 1. Look at the comments on this site around turnover, treating people poorly, sick culture, and weak senior leadership. These are all very accurate. 2. No training, management training, or development. The philosophy is if you don’t have what we need, we will replace you (i.e., fire you for not being a “good fit”) with someone from the outside who has that. 3. Hourly jobs in particular have stagnant pay. 4. There are no bonuses or incentives. 5. The culture has serious problems.   a. You will see countless references on this site to a “culture of fear”. This is widespread in every department and division. Even executives laugh that their time is numbered. A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term. When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem.   b. A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back. Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe. They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above. Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person. The 360 review process reinforces this. Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings. They have fired or seen so many people let go that they don’t really care anymore. 6. You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching. Most employees don’t bring any personal belongings to work as they could be let go at any moment. It is often a surprise. 7. Do not move for a job with Netflix. If your partner or spouse doesn’t work, you could be risking your families financial health. There is no job security regardless of how good you are. Performance does not equal security at Netflix. 8. Managers have a 1 year shelf life before they get shown the door. Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn. 9. HR’s job is to hire and show people the door. HR brags about how good they are at firing people. They don’t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better. Their role is simply to ensure the company doesn’t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over. 10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees. Leaders are asked could they hire someone better. Of course the answer will always be yes. 11. No severance package is enough to compensate you for disruption in your career, moving, or the stress that comes without having a job. 12. The recruiting function will hire you fast. The idea is to keep you excited, but if you are reading this don’t get caught up in the Netflix product of movies—look at whether this is actually a place you want to work. 13. It’s incredibly stressful and life-shortening for you and your loved ones. Why work at a place where people, including your hiring managers, treat you as completely disposable? 1. Change out your HR leadership. They are in love with the culture, but they are creating an unhealthy long term environment. Once the economy picks up you will not be able to treat people as poorly as you do. 2. Change the culture of fear. Install real coaching, feedback, and performance reviews so employees can feel comfortable doing their jobs. 3. Do some employee surveys to learn the real thoughts of your front line team. 4. Stop the turnover that is higher than comparable companies. 5. Reed, if you are not a people person, hire some people who are.

Many people complain about them, but I always thought they were pretty good. They'll all provided by the same vendor though, so it's easy to get tired of them. The buildings are nice enough. It is easy to get whatever hardware, software, or gadget you think you need. Top-end Mac or Thinkpad with a giant display? An extra desktop or two? Whatever, just put in a ticket and you'll have it in a couple of days or sooner. Need some nice servers for your project? A couple hundred cloud instances? It's all available with minimal fuss. When it comes to people, Netflix is a throw away culture. Most people last somewhere around two years before they leave or quit. There seems to be no barriers to stop a manager from firing anyone that works for them. If your manager likes you, everything is peachy but if s/he doesn't like you for any reason at all, you're quickly out the door.  A lot of time gets wasted by new people trying to figure out how a thing works, or (more often) just ripping it out and creating something new since whoever built it is long gone. Then these new people move on to the next company and the cycle starts again.  The ""high performance culture"" in practice means that there are very few useless people. The downside is that you always know that your job is temporary and you're always worried that you'll be fired. It's a stressful way to live.  Netflix prides itself on being a ""nimble"" company. It will occasionally do amazing things in a very short time period. Deadlines can be crazy and they often don't take into account other work that needs to be done. Projects don't replace the workload you already have, they just add to it. Many times you'll deliver on a deadline only to find out that the work was unnecessary as someone decided to completely change the architecture or cancel the project completely.  Everyone is assumed to be available 24x7x365. Email is sent and replied to at all hours of all days and nights. You can never let go of work.  Lastly, the company philosophy is to pay employees and let them decide what to do with the money, so there aren't a ton of perqs for working there. Benefits are okay but not great. No real gym membership, onsite masseuses or anything fancy. The whole company used to go to Sundance every year (payed for by Netflix) but they stopped that some years ago. There is a price to pay for treating employees as easily replaceable commodities. The lack of process and documentation coupled with high turnover means that once a person has been there long enough to understand the environment, it's time to go.  Netflix goes to a lot of trouble to hire great people. It puts very little effort into keeping them. Employees live with a lot of stress and some fear knowing that they could be fired at any time no matter how hard they work, no matter how long they worked there, and no matter what they accomplished for the company.  Putting a little effort into retaining good employees will make for a happier workforce and more efficiency.",9.113201,-8.935414,0.02666787090618592,0.0712752277116214,4.0,0.19318331339712919,0.5383532695374798

Promotions for Financial Analyst positions are given externally to candidates with MBA's even though team members who have been stuck in the same position for years are qualified and capable and managers in this department don't even have a Bachelors degree. Rules are not enforced uniformly throughout the team but rather enforced upon certain team members who are singled out. Any new responsibilities we take on are always considered lateral rather than upward movement and the outlook for advancement if you ever want to be considered a ""real"" Financial Analyst or even a Manager are grim. Any attempt to discuss our feelings with management is looked down upon as complaining rather than expressing our concerns. Be fair, consider the team's feelings, motivate and encourage growth, be positive, listen to us and do not put us down. We do not need to be micromanaged. We do desire advancement and we are smart and knowledgeable in our fields. Give us a chance to learn and consider us for promotions. If an internal candidate applies and does not get the job, let he or she know what she can do to get the job the next time it or a similar position becomes available. Just because the economy offers so many highly qualified and experienced individuals doesn't mean we should be discounted.

49154,apple,2011,"There are some real opportunities for rapid growth at Apple. There really is. That makes this job, in my opinion, the best retail experience you can have. I came into Apple without ANY retail experience and I'm now confident enough with it that I really could take on any kind of retail sales experience. If you enjoy staying busy, being surrounded with questions coming from many different ways and being part of a company that has arguably the most in-demand technology in the world, Apple is an amazing place to work. With that said, it's a tough place to leave because people end up getting so emotionally connected to the benefits of working for such a profitable, growing and family-oriented company. I love every minute of it. Because Apple products are always incredibly innovative and well designed, there is an incredible demand for them. The retail stores are essentially the ""face of Apple"" therefore they are thee only places many people know to get their Apple products. What this means with a job at Apple is that you will ALWAYS be busy, you will ALWAYS be pressed to work more hours and you will find it VERy difficult to get time off. For instance, I once requested the week BEFORE Thanksgiving off 5 MONTHS in advance, and wasn't approved for it. It's tough but logical. Apple has tried to accomodate by hiring more staff but unfortunately Apple cannot seem to hire enough people as the demand just continues to grows at an unbelievable pace. Apple retail management does an incredible job of offering what they call ""Fearless Feedback"" to employees. They also give many opportunities for growth and training internally. There is always more than enough time for both of those items. Like I said before though, the stores stay incredibly busy and it's not going to stop. There needs to be at least 15-20 more people hired per store so that we can stay ahead of the curve and so that we can take care of all customers that need assistance. The real part of Apple retail is customer experience, no sales. It's having your customers leave impressed, all of their questions answered and excited to come back in the future knowing that they'd get the same experience. Recently I've seen a huge decrease in this because there is simply is not enough staff to take care of everyone that needs help. The on again and off again rushes and demand that retail stores see needs to be modified and made consistant with Apples true vision: something that ""Just Works"".

The discount was ok I guess but that is not much of a perk especially when we can't get an iPad discount for 6 months after the product was released. The training was good and I learned a lot about Apple products. Good benefits if you can get management to put you as full time and get them. Freedom to have your own style. Great technology for training and of course Easy Pays. People think its cool that you work for Apple. Dishonesty. Management plays games with you and tells you you will have all these career opportunities and that you can get promoted. It is a lie, its all about putting your time in.  I was a top performer and so were many others that I know that have since left. If you have talent this place is frustrating. They don't care about performance they care about who they like and who has been there the longest.  If you want to be in management you must be brought in as a manager. It will take you YEARS to become a manager starting as a specialist no matter how good you are. All my managers came from Gap or Starbucks with zero product knowledge. Many with very little management experience even. I have a college degree in Business Management and they brought in a manager with no education from Starbucks and put them over me. This person had managed at Starbucks for a year.  Managers are not really managers. They are schedule makers and schedule keepers. They simply make the schedules and send people on break and lunch. They do not chart profitability, inventory or any thing that requires skill.  The hours are terrible. You have to keep an open schedule if you want to work there full time. That means you can be scheduled from as early as 5am during holiday, to 3am to do overnight. Or in NY they have a 24 hour store I just feel sorry for them.  The pay is embarrassing. I personally sold over 1 million dollars worth of product last year. I did not get a raise. I did not get a bonus. I got a small roll up blanket at Christmas that fell apart the first time I washed it. Oh ya and my pay was $23,000 while living in Northern California where rent is about 1200 for a 2 bedroom. You do the math. All of this while Apple just became the most valuable company in the world.  I am not writing this because I am bitter. I am actually quite happy. I have since left Apple and I am making great money doing something I love. I simply wrote this to hopefully give people an accurate detailed description of what it is really like to work for Apple. Also I hope the people in Cupertino that are in charge of Retail development read this as well because I know from working with them that they are clueless to what really goes on in the store. Your customer service rating will go down and you will lose business because people who are talented will not stay in an environment with no opportunity.  I see so many people who fall into the propaganda and think they will some day work for corporate or get into management. It is a fantasy. If you are thinking I just worked at 1 store that must have been a bad one, actually I worked at 2 and observed others. They are all like this. Look at who really has talent and figure out a way to promote from within. You destroy the morale of the employees when people from the outside are brought in over those who have talent and have put in a lot of hard work and want that position. Why not reward those who you already know and have invested in rather than strangers off the street.",5.5401087,-11.008777,0.016147407600340946,0.06918123746221644,2.0,0.19272073412698412,0.47282454648526084

You may be excited by this, but even on days when you feel terrible, there is absolutely nowhere to hide. This may be great for the first month or two, but down the line, it's a horrendous feeling to be bombarded by customers non-stop for a whole shift, especially when questions are always the same! As an employee of Apple Retail you are the lowest of the low.. You know NOTHING, and never will! But customers just won't believe you... The discount isn't even good!!! When you consider how much money you're bringing into the company every shift, which you get 0 commission for (or so they say...), you'd think the discount would be MUCH better. 16hrs is the minimum contract, no matter how good you are! If you're thinking about going into the company then dropping down hours, they WILL get rid of you before your 3month probation ends, again, no matter how good you are. Having to sell different add-ons with products is patronising, and such a con, because you get nothing for it... Unless you're looking to be promoted, in which case it means everything, because your sales figures are taken into account. Hilarious! This is why nobody ever gets to easily access management from a sales position, because if your sales figures are THAT good, why would Apple not want you active on the shop-floor? It's a vicious Apply circle. Apple constantly hire people, because they can. Ultimately, you mean nothing to them. If you're not happy with something, they'll get rid of you, and hire a shiny new specialist into the business. Apple Retail UK is NOT Apple Inc. You're working in a shop, which happens to be called Apple, selling computers for an hourly wage. Don't think you're anything special, because you're really not. Recognise the potential of your Red-Zone team, and be grateful that such skilled and potentially-brilliant people throw themselves at the opportunity to work for your company. If you want Apple Retail UK to BE different to other retailers, don't act like other retailers! Recruit management from within. A huge number of people only join the company as Specialists in order to move up the chain, then realise this won't happen, but remain in their roles because something's better than nothing, right? Wrong. Don't dangle a carrot in front of your employees faces, just be straight up with them. You WILL NOT progress to management from being a Specialist.

You need to have a certain attitude to work at Apple, and if you fit in then you just fit in. Don't get me wrong though--although they do look for a certain attitude, our team was very diverse. I met so many interesting people there, and i still keep in touch with many of them. Pay was pretty good compared to other mall jobs. Discounts here are okay but not amazing, though the free MobileMe account is definitely nice if you own multiple Apple products. Though I had lots of great customer interactions here, I also encountered a LOT of extraordinarily rude customers. I have had customers personally attack me (for example, dropping f-bombs on me when I told them that they'd need to wait 5-10 minutes to see a Genius, and telling me I'm incompetent even though fixing iPhones isn't in my job description) and almost cried in the Red Zone on multiple occasions. Managers push numbers hard--even though you don't make commission. We actually had a wall that had not only the best sales numbers for the day, but also the worst, which I find completely inappropriate. Totally inflexible scheduling. Although I was part-time, they worked me as many hours as possible and you need to request off work several months in advance, even if it's just one day. Then, my biggest gripe--there is literally no room for advancement here. They tell you that there is plenty of room to grow with Apple, but in reality, they hire outside the company for almost all of the management positions. There isn't much incentive to perform when there is little chance of growth. And forget moving to corporate--it's pretty much completely separate from the Retail division. Finally, the vibe here is (surprise, surprise) a bit cult-ish...there are special procedures for doing literally everything, even giving a compliment to your co-worker. You are expected to do your job and never, ever question the company or its motives.

60086,microsoft,2011,"Benefits such as health insurance are excellent, although they are being slowly whittled away. The Seattle area location is good because the cost of living is lower than California. The company has money to burn, so getting approval for equipment or travel is no problem. Most permanent employees still get private offices, although that's changing and is group dependent. The main problem is that the best people are leaving, and those who remain are less and less competent every year (but don't seem to know that). It seems that the best new hires don't want to work at Microsoft and choose to go elsewhere.  Recognition and career success comes primarily from telling management what it wants to hear, rather than from good work or doing what customers want. In the past, middle management was technically competent but mediocre at managing people (which they knew, but didn't care). Today, management is too often poor on all dimensions but doesn't even know it. Many managers are incapable of recognizing good work, much less knowing how to do it themselves or how to encourage people to deliver it. Managers take care of themselves and their peers first, suppressing other opinions, rather than standing up for employees.  The company is a giant bureaucracy. The easiest way to succeed at Microsoft, like any bureaucracy, is to tell everyone what they want to hear, keep your head down, and don't challenge anything. It's better to do work that is tolerably good but not excellent (because great work would be a threat to others). This attitude seems to come down from the top, where very real threats to the company are covered up in platitudes about how ""next year will be great!"", year after year after year.  Having said this, the culture varies from group to group, some are awful while others can be supportive and good places to work. However, it's impossible to know in advance what any group is like, and continual reorganizations (every six months on average) mean that it could change at any moment and go from great to terrible with no warning.  Another major problem is the review system. Employees are forced onto curves within their groups, regardless of the group's overall strength, and managers are able to pick and choose peer feedback to punish anyone they wish. If you happen to end with a manager who doesn't like you or feels threatened, then you will get a bad review. And only the most recent review counts for anything. Even with a string of great reviews, if the most recent one is bad, you will be unable to look for other jobs within the company. Thus, a single bad manager effectively can force you out of the company. This explains why employees worry so much more about telling managers what they want, rather than doing great work.  Given increasingly incompetent management, flat stock price, and disincentives for excellent work, it's no surprise that the best employees are leaving in droves for Amazon, Facebook, Zynga, startups, and pretty much anywhere they can. The primary barrier to the exodus is that there are not many options in Seattle.  In short, if you would like a nice office and benefits but don't care that much about your work or career path, OR if you prefer to play politics and don't mind backstabbing others, then Microsoft could be a good place for you. But if you want to excel, to do something interesting, or to be rewarded for real innovation, it's the wrong place. Get rid of the many managers who are incompetent despite being there for long periods of time. Replace them with managers who are technically excellent and who believe in promoting excellence among their employees. Replace the current review system with one focused on excellent results (e.g., as determined by peer reviewers across the company) rather than merely the approval of one's team.",-0.75569326,-4.714811,-0.010822846342479818,0.04079500803381642,2.0,0.1680548176570904,0.5174141168175259

Further, there are many more planning and vision meetings than necessary to nail down a focus or a feature. This is true at the team, project, and org levels. Planning and verification are absolutely necessary, but not to the extent of obnoxiously slow development and response to bugs.  In my opinion, there's too much ""kool-aid"" in the company. I understand people are passionate about our products and what we do, but there's a hypocrisy in teaching ""avoid 'Not Invented Here' syndrome"" while simultaneously challenging competitor products on purely emotional instead factual grounds.

There has been a noticeable increase in risk aversion. Management is so conservative that some people are unwilling to even take risks on their own employees much less big bets in the marketplace. Also, it is very hard to grow professionally which I believe is due in large part to how conservative Microsoft has become.  In addition, it is really hard to move around at Microsoft.

60357,microsoft,2011,"-- People The company has grown a lot in 20 years from < 10k people in size to the a combined count of full time, contract, vendor, etc. totaling almost 100k people in size. As a result the ""bar"" for working there has certainly changed over time - but let me tell you Microsoft still has a lot of smart people working there. The challenge is finding the right place for yourself where you 'click' with your peers and more important your management and feel it is the right place for you.  -- Types of opportunities Microsoft offers a little bit of something for anyone interested in computer science, consumer project management, marketing, etc. Computer Science problems galore from operating system kernels (windows, windows phone, xbox, windows embedded), games (xbox, pc games, mobile games), search engines (bing.com, FAST), productivity software (office, sharepoint), compilers (CLR, CLR for mobile, Visual Studio), etc. etc. with something to offer for just about anyone.  Outside of tech specific jobs, Microsoft has a huge legal department, hr department, etc. Keep in mind that even though each of those departments has a core set of employees as much as possible that is not business essential is farmed out to vendors and contractors as well - which can be a totally different spin on ""working for"" Microsoft.  --- Getting things done: You can find an expert in just about anything. Finding others that share a passion for a specific type of technology, a specific type of business problem, or a particular area of research is usually very easy. Especially if you are not afraid of asking people for a push in the right direction in email over and over until you find someone that is right to tackle a problem you're focused on. But it requires the soft skills of working in the BIG (and I mean BIG) company that Microsoft has now become. But this can lead you to the pm/dev/tester/architect that owns that problem set and is more than willing to bring you up to speed on the focus of their passion. Huge plus! -- Job scope Microsoft has grown into a company where a lot of the jobs have rigidly defined scopes and it becomes about doing whatever it is that will please your maanger and maybe one to two of their peers to do ""well"" at review time. It used to take an understanding of the product and the business and someone that was willing to step up and ""do the right thing"" at the right time to make sure the product would ship on time and with high quality. Now it feels that more people just look to management to spoon feed them what they will do for the next day or week... I miss the vision each person used to take into the job where they wanted to become the world expert in ____ and make that area they owned the best code / solution possible. Again - this could be an artifact of the large growth and maybe there are just as many folks still doing what I am wishing for as there was 15 years ago but it gets drowned out in the signal:noise ratio. --Senior Management There are a lot of VPs and a lot of Partners.  ""Partner"" is an attribution in a title (like ""Partner Development Manager"", ""Partner Group Program Manager"", ""Partner Development Manager"") that means the person is withing grasp of getting a ""Vice President"" title. It is possible to achieve ""Partner"" as either a manger or an individual contributor.  There are probably 200+ VPs and ~1500 partners. They shape the core of the senior management and are in large part what set the agenda for the business and the core R&D work that will be done throughout the product groups. Each of them has gotten to their position by being noticed for their efforts and are recognized and rewarded extraordinarily well.  It feels (and this may be unfair - but it is my perspective) that a great deal of these VPs and Partners are actually counterproductive to the business. Many of them seems to be a caricature of themselves overly accentuating the negative aspects of their personalities with only a few being able to escape this criticism. Many seem like overpaid and overgrown children unwilling to sit at the table and negotiate between each other and set long term shared goals that are a compromise and work towards a common infrastructure and reduction in overlap of the groups they own.  Advice specifically to the management of Microsoft: - Everything you vps and partners do is a complete chess game trying to figure out how to make the next guy look less favorable than themselves. It's unacceptable. At that level you get paid enough that this shouldn't be the goal - grow up and figure out how to make peace with each other and drive towards combined goals of greater efficiency.  - By the time someone becomes a VP or Partner at Microsoft they have lost their technical edge and very very very few of them could actually go into their own group's software and make fixes or have anything to actually contribute to the day to day life of an individual developer or tester on the team.  - Don't attempt to take the latest ""management technique"" from Facebook/Netflix/Whatever Co. that you read about in an in-flight magazine on the way back from Hawaii and apply it to a group of 2000 people under you that were not hired to fit the mold of that company's philosophy and culture.",-8.48606,-2.6367476,-0.05251924408387681,0.03984667388513677,3.0,0.15908981314044604,0.4883810528430782

Now it's 10% and only last day price. Company store discounts also have decreased gradually and morale events budgets are just a fraction what they used to be. Review model is broken since it's not directly tied to absolute performance of you and your team. And since everything is budgeted in advance including promotions everything is pretty much fixed. Also this model is mostly based on internal competition using vague metrics. I feel you work against each other really in the end... Even if you can demonstrate you made a bigger impact and improved products or helped increase revenue it's not going to have as big impact as other internal factors. Cross team collaboration and not being recognized helping others are eternal issues in the polls which is related to that.  Promotions are uneven and often unfair. There are examples where someone doesn't get promoted for several years and someone else gets promoted twice within 2 years even though the difference isn't even clear. Sometimes it pays long-term to move to another team which should not make a difference but it can.  Hiring diversity is unbalanced last couple of years. Vast majority of all new hires are Indian (80% for all candidates I interviewed). I'm not sure why it's getting tougher to get US candidates. But that might be true for other companies as well. 1. Change uneven review system and look at direct market results for rewarding teams. Don't judge internally only but also externally. 2. Too slow to respond to external market challenges (mobile phones and now Windows slates). This is the biggest issue since this also causes perceived image issues.

60442,microsoft,2011,"1. Low cost of living 2. Big name company 3. Close to the newest tech trend 4. Well defined career path Traditionally the worklife in Microsoft teams are known to be relaxed and laid back, but I work in one of the new Cloud-computing related teams who tries to put new services online, and workload here as SDET is horrible. I often work 75+ hours a week in order to complete all the works. Not only me but I also hear complaints from colleagues in the same team about the workload. The workload comes in the following ways: 1. Scheduling: the management will try to ""persuade"" you to compress the schedule into what fits their schedule needs, ignoring the true task time costs, and all the uncertain factors that could delay the schedule. Once you sign on that schedule, all factors that drag you down need to be paid from your own pocket -- your personal time. By forcing you to commit to such scheduling, they implicitly put you to work long hours. 2. On-demand tasks: when you are signed on to work on a 1 month long project that needs 8 hours dedicated time each day, the management will try to randomly give instruction to you to take care of some random tasks, which could take 3 hours a day. At the same time they track your progress on the scheduled task. 3. Incidents: you need to take care of incidents, such as cluster down or test reported failures. Which could take 4 hours for each incident. At the time you signed-up to work on a 8 hours-day pre-planned project. 4. You can get promoted only if you work extra time: the management will assign you with all those routine tasks that would already take you 10+ hours a day. For promotion, as they said, you need to do something beyond routine that would impress them. That means you find another project besides your already long hours routine tasks, to get recognized. 5. Code changes everywhere: as the Cloud related project is fast growing, all the components were changing, and your existing code can be broken by other people anytime. Then you need to take care of that.  Besides the workload, also there is issue in: 1. No core competency developed in SDET job role: even with such long hours daily working time, most things I do are low level: writing straght-forward-logic C# code (like scripts), take care of some config text files, copy-paste test failures' stack traces, start test runs, spend 5 hours to find out a way to hack the dev component to test something they didn't provide interface. I believe I won't be able to find another job after doing things like for 3 more years. 2. The pay scale is definitely not worthy for this workload. I of heard people in Amazon complaining their workload due to nature of online services (fast pace, incidents, etc), but their pay is 30% higher. I think now I am doing the same amount of work as they, as at substantially lower salary. none",-2.7962928,-21.446764,-0.037017829759353985,0.05977942371287461,2.0,0.0009771629336846647,0.4349500439174353

The place bleeds talent from every pour, but the culture keeps the best thinking in check - while the loudest, most senior bullies push their personal opinions into product designs. MSFT says its results-driven, but there isn't any accountability when the loud-mouths in management get it wrong. A product planning process that takes almost as long as the work to build it? Waterfall doesn't even begin to describe how slowly MSFT moves. The company is too big, the products lack meaningful innovation and you only seem to react to innovation by competition with meaningless, watered-down half efforts. Simplify the business and the products will follow. Let the people who know how to ship great products lead the product design process.

Another reason is the access to the technology and working with really sharp, driven people. At least in our consulting practice there are no (or very few) lazy types. With a company the size of Microsoft, they sometimes have difficulty stopping and turning direction on a dime. Or worse yet, be ahead of their time and fail to capitalize on their early arrival in a market (tablets, mobile, search) For years I have offered this advice to management via MSPOLL. My advice is that you cannot run this company like it was in the 80's and 90's. You can't put a product out in the market, fall behind, and do this ""keep coming and coming and coming"" mentality. How many billions of dollars are wasted with this approach (search?) when those dollars should have been spent doing it right the first time. WIth today's technology you pretty much get one chance to win a customer to your platform.
