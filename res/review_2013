1,google,2013,"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.  3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).  5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.  6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below). 1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.  3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :( 1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management.  2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done, what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed?  3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.",-2.646656,-5.3389926,-0.02642411703499817,0.03971485342513406,4.0,0.1506259780907668,0.5884194053208138

Salary isn't the best on the market. Google knows it can pay less than it has to, because people want to work for it. Google has departments working on formulas meant to pay you as little as possible. Huge fight to get to the top - everyone is in a race. A culture of overachievers, which means you have to sacrifice personal and social life to move up the ranks. I've seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing. Too much. Also, middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you. Everything is in formulas, and just doing a great job is not enough. You need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted. Also, the commute from the city sucks. Oh, and the company's product strategy is a laughing stock. Google jumps on every shiny object. It's one thing to reinvent an industry, but to launch clones is just low. Google+ is shoved down everyone's throat. Google Offers was a Groupon clone. And nobody cares about the user, the company is totally evil. Decisions are made based on $$$, and not the user in mind.

4025,google,2013,"Had to add my own thoughts after seeing so many concerns about work-life balance at Google. I joined Google about a year ago after many years in mid-tier management consulting. For me, it's been a refreshing return to work-life balance. No, that doesn't mean I work 35 hr weeks. I'm often at Google before 7am and sometimes stay past 7pm. I work hard because I want to be the best in my profession, because I believe I should earn all those perks Google is famous for, and because my team, who want to be the best in their professions, are relying on me.  That said, I've never worked into the wee hours of the morning. Every Saturday and Sunday you'll find me outside running or biking, not in the office. I have a wonderful marriage, get 8 hrs sleep every night and am fortunate to be leaving a happy life.  In contrast, my consulting career was full of 70 hr workweeks, travel away from my family, unbelievable levels of stress and piles of politics. Maybe Google is also like this at the VP and SVP level, I'm not sure. But I'm about half way up the so-called corporate ladder and, at least from my perspective, things are refreshingly balanced and authentic. Again, I'm only 1 year in so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.  The other myth I'd like to debunk (actually, it appears to already be long-before debunked) is that only ivy-grads can get into Google. From what I've heard, this was more true 10 years ago. But, I attended a small undergrad school you've probably never heard of and haven't been back to school since. I think what Google is looking for is the same as any company: people with honest passion for their trade, who don't mind putting in some elbow grease to keep the company growing. Let's be honest: Google spoils it's employees. We're all fortunate to work here. The thing I worry about most is whether I'm making a real difference. Google has such a legacy, and such infinite resources, that it can be a little overwhelming trying to figure out if you're taking full advantage of the opportunity. For example, I'm guessing that the job posting that started my career here had maybe 100 other applicants. That's 100 people who could have done a better job if I feel like ""taking it easy"" today. I worry about doing well enough here to continue he legacy built before me. Larry does a great job as far as I can tell.

Pay is decent, but not as good as elsewhere. I'm used to startup culture, and I had a serious culture shock coming to Google. Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic. There is an obscenely long and restrictive ""style guide"" of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I'm used to. Code reviews sometimes become bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months. The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave. My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress. Also the culture is biased towards ""perfect"" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon. This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.  The worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company. I worked on various projects that my manager assigned (there wasn't much discretion in choosing things to work on, and the vaunted 20% time is just hype), and my manager had a lot of ""pet projects"" that he wanted done but didn't really have any great justification for why they should be done at all.  Anyway Google is a big company and managers and teams vary in quality. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are much happier than me, but I also think my situation is hardly unique. Don't assign engineers to projects before their start date and assume that the employee will be happy with whatever crappy project they are assigned to. Give ""nooglers"" a change to sample several different teams for the first month or so and then give them some leeway to choose a project that matters personally to them.

For all the talk of Google being a metrics driven company...staffing seems ridiculously off - they talk in terms of numbers yes but most of the time the leadership barely even knows what targets staffing is chasing. Seniority is rarely rewarded and rather than giving opportunities to top performers for people to grow, politics & smooth talking is rewarded. The problem with Google is that it lulls you into a comfort zone, so you keep doing your job which has decent compensation & perks. But if you are looking to build a career- be prepared to navigate through the red tape & much snubbing- unless of course you can smooth talk your way through. This is not a phenomenon exclusive to Google, though I have seen it to be much more prevalent at Google than elsewhere- mind you that I have worked with several larger global organizations in the past. Google is just a big company - its does not have a start-up environment despite what the top brass says.

Systematically rewards only short term results, which leads to exponential compounding of code cruft. I mean they give explicit instructions for calibration and promo to consider only demonstrable benefits of the last 6 months of work, and nothing earlier than that which had a delayed benefit. So the rank and file are forced to be like shitty mutual fund managers obsessed with quarterly results, in contrast to the upper management's supposed long term focus.  When you start they flip a coin and if it comes up tails you are stuck in ads for years against your will.  20% time is a lie. 20% time is essentially unpaid overtime and if god forbid your 20% time takes a risk and fails you will be calibrated as if you had spent that time doing nothing.  Every creative idea is shot down in favor of the same old safe but inefficient crap. All the projects come from the top down. There is no bottom-up innovation in ads because they try to keep everyone 110% busy with top down mandates. The company hasn't really innovated much in years. All their fast growing products are acquisitions or ""me too"" and the ads infrastructure is bloated and ossified.  There's a lot of witness-tampering when it comes to peer reviews and stack ranks. You aren't allowed to rate your experience working with a person. You're supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with. And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager's opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you.  Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous. Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever projects you want to do. It's all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers.  I've read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience. A lot of the managers were hired from outside the company and tracked their shitty culture in with them. Perhaps that explains it. Fix the incentive structures to reward behavior that furthers the long term interests of the company and the employees. Fire managers that get bad Googlegeist results and promote from within.

This is a good thing for the company, but can drive employees crazy when it comes to hacking through the weeds standing between you and pushing larger projects through to completion. Google needs to extend it's speedy product development mantra to the micro level of its individual internal workings.  Work-Life Balance As a company, Google is actually pretty good about this. Many individual teams, however, focus on global dependencies, which both slows things down and result in a 24-hour-a-day need to be connected. Emails time-stamped 2am on a Saturday are commonplace.

But receive no promise for their hard work and are unappreciated by management. Management is not allowed to give temporary workers any type of feedback as to their performance and are unable to pull them aside to tell them they are doing a good job, nor room for improvement. Place water fountains on the DC Floor. Give employees more breaks to prevent bodily injury such as carpel tunnel syndrome. Communicate with your employees more frequently to receive feedback rather than once a month meetings as to our goals. Allow employees to submit anonymous suggestions like this advice text box. Allow temporary employees the same supervisory advice Googlers are given and give them advice on ways to improve. Don't be a jerk! And don't be evil!

Various events such as ski trips are clearly designed to encourage people from different parts of the company to get to know each other. Tech talks are designed to create a culture of always learning instead of stagnating and becoming too settled in a small niche. 1. It's a big, established company. It's easy to feel like you're just a cog and will never have a big impact in it.  2. There's no well-defined career path, which doesn't bother me personally but might bother people with different personalities.  3.

Guest speakers and lectures have ranged from celebrity visitors, to heads of state, to famous bloggers with specific domain expertise like ""The Strobist"" whose blog is followed by the photography cognoscenti.

There are relatively few Pros that survived my first 2 months here and that I'll miss when I leave.

My experience, unfortunately, has been almost entirely negative: - problems start with the hiring process because they put up vaguely described job openings, don't tell you almost anything about what you'll be working on during the interview, and then don't make any attempt to match you to projects you might care about or have experience with. The implied message is - you made it to Google, so you're smart enough to learn new technology, languages, and skills as needed, and we give you so much that you should be happy working on anything. After working here for several months, my impression was: - self-satisfaction, detachment/cluelessness/apathy and arrogance are prevalent including at the very top. - too many of the company's core slogans frequently don't reflect reality:     - treating employees with respect - actually condescension disguised as benevolence     - caring about users - actually often dismissing them as a nuisance or too stupid to use the product correctly.     - setting goals that are so ambitious that you fail on some - actually often failing on un-ambitious goals for non-respectable reasons     - openness in communicating with employees - actually, most communications end up being empty hype and ass-kissing.     - maximise efficiency and productivity - actually, even simple web front ends requires constant battle against unrelated problems with unreasonably slow or broken internal APIs, overly slow build/test/deploy tools, lack of documentation for how to use internal systems, etc.      - fast-paced entrepreneurial culture - actually, for too many people, the main objective is to look good and score points with their manager - this is true all the way up to the VPs that report to Larry      - hire the best people - almost everybody here is really smart, but the culture often brings out the worst most unprofessional side of people       - taking risks and changing the world - level of risk I see people taking is changing the location of a UI button on an internal tool without talking to the product manager first From what I saw while working on internal tools, it seems for too many managers, their highest aspiration is to keep employees occupied and to avoid looking bad in front of superiors.

Google has some internal learning classes etc. but I didn't find it as useful as people, projects and the codebase.  Another thing is the ""hackability"". With the tools we have it's very simple to start hacking on something and you can focus on solving problems. If you have an idea that you want to try, often you can have something ready within a day or two with no frustrations coming from fighting the tools all the time. I think that internal mobility could be improved. It's easy to start to work on something as 20%, but when it comes to 100% it's a bit tricky.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone. Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data.

23888,amazon,2013,"The pros are what others have already said. Working for this world class brand that is changing the face of retail is exciting (in theory). There is a lot going on in Seattle and to some extent in satellite offices like New York. The environment can be exciting in the sense that we're creating game changing products and services.  You will also learn more here in a very short amount of time than most anywhere else due to the emphasis on testing, analyzing and improving your work. I am basically going to squeeze out as much learning as possible and then parlay this into a better job shortly. I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of employees feel the same way. Employees simply do no come first in this organization. Employees are way down on the priority list. Thus, there is little attention paid to building a healthy culture, feeling like a 'team', recognizing great work through bonuses and raises, etc. There are absolutely no perks to speak of either which I can appreciate due to the money losing business moves we deliberately make to poise Amazon for world domination in the future. However, the lack of resources and basic things to do your job are painful and just plain bad business. Lack of HR support, tech support, etc. is utterly painful and results in a waste of employee time trying to do basic things. This is especially pronounced in non HQ offices which are sadly under resourced in every way.  Internal systems are some of the most hacked together, pathetic systems I have seen in my life. And I have worked for traditional blue chip companies that do not know their ass from their elbows, for lack of a better phrase! Amazon is on the cutting edge in every customer facing thing it does but when it comes to internal systems, everything is arcane, painful to use, poorly built and just plain pathetic.  Amazon hires smart people but not well rounded people. I find the culture to be impacted negatively by the weird, humorless, dry, and oddly aggressive people that flourish here. Communications are shockingly terse and rude. Things just need to get done, you can spare any pleasantries if you know what is good for you. I guess that's the Amazon way? Very few people will want to tolerate this long term, as evidenced by heavy and frequent turn over.  Finally, leadership at Amazon is probably doing a great job in their bubbles inventing crazy things, but they are severely lacking when it comes to communicating, inspiring and exciting employees. In my time here, I have not once heard from Bezos or for that matter anyone who works for him, in a meaningful way. The CEO is simply non-existent to me. Due to this, I do not feel connected to the company and its mission aside from my direct work. Pay a lot more attention to employee happiness. You hire smart, capable people who leave on average within two years. That is a problem given the dearth of capable people on this planet. Do more for your employees, build a great culture and cut us some slack on this frugality thing so that we can at least have the appropriate tools to do our jobs! Your frugal (or rather downright cheap) mindset will be your undoing when you have no extraordinary people left to do your bidding.  Install better managers at every level. The people managing teams in this office and from what I hear in Seattle, are often average, mediocre people managers with little to offer their teams. I'm sure they are bright individual contributors, but that does not a manager make. That's a problem.  Work harder to make non Seattle offices feel integrated into Amazon's overall culture and ecosystem.

23908,amazon,2013,"Amazon's customer focus is the most genuine I've worked with to date, not like other companies who put some fancy words on the wall then do everything they can to ignore them.  Compensation is decent, especially singing bonuses which are huge. Relocation expenses are generous especially for expat hires. Share plan is pretty decent, if weighted toward later years.  Teams are very small - usually around 10-20 people - so relatively agile groups working on thousands of different things all at the same time so there's always something new and exciting being announced. Coordination between teams is mostly achieved though management which leaves the engineers on the ground free to execute.  Amazon is really ideal for interns, junior and mid-level developers - it's a great place to cut your teeth on big problems, get a lot of responsibility very quickly and rack up those crucial years of experience for your CV with a company that looks great  Amazon itself is clearly still on the way up. For a company that makes no money, it's growing super fast, doubling it's full time staff every couple of years, taking on more and more projects, breaking into new markets and technologies. If there's a peak Amazon is still a way from reaching it and the stock price reflects this  The head office is dog friendly - you can take your dog to work with you which is pretty cool You'll notice reading reviews here are very mixed, and the reason for this are those aforementioned small teams. While this creates agility, is also creates huge disparity. The manager pretty much controls everything, so score a bad, ineffective or incompetent one and you're life just became hell. Some teams have insane on-call demands, others crazy work hours and deliverable pressure, some dysfunctional processes and decision making, and yet two floors away there'll be a cluster of 100's with great work life balance, competent management and great processes. It really is hit and miss, and if you'e unlucky you're stuck for the next 12 months.  Management in general is also hit and miss. The general shortage in the sector has meant especially in Seattle a flood of ex-Microsoft jumping ship, bringing with them a mentality which is as alien to Amazon's original culture as you can get which is starting to show. Decision making is increasingly pushed up the chain by deadlocked committees that have way too many people present, project launches pushed back, QA blindly executing thousands of test cases which no one has any serious faith in but yet will still block releases, etc.  There is an element of shortest-path mentality to the customer focus (frugality after all is a core value). This isn't Apple - rarely is the ""best possible experience"" a factor in decision making, rather push it into production as quickly as possible and worry about coming back to fix it later, knowing full well that actually never happens. The experience is patchy - some areas of the software will be amazingly tuned while others barely function. Some teams won't do anything without data and an A|B test to back it up, where's others will agonize for months over the right color background for the top-right corner in meetings that drag on for hours way overloaded with senior management.  Benefits are pretty minimal. Sure there's great insurance, commuter benefits, etc. but food is minimal, catering is non-existent, free drinks or entertainment a rarity and leave entitlements stingy. The technology they give you to work with is a joke when 32Gb of RAM costs like $100 these days and laptops come with 4Gb and weigh a tonne. Watch out - your 401k dollar matching is in Amazon stock that won't vest for 3 years, your RSU is heavily weighted to your 3-4 years and most employees don't make it past 2. Pay rises are small and grudging, and bonuses pretty much non-existent. Leave entitlements are really stingy.  Most mobility is lateral - individuals moving between teams - as getting promoted is really difficult, even from SDE I to II. Most senior positions that open up are filled from the market, and career mentoring is pretty much non-existent. Promotions are done by committees with managers fighting each other for a small number of slots, regardless of the merit of each individual, and ""bar raisers"" who will actively oppose anyone not performing above a bell curve that is disproportionately out of sync with the reality of the actual talent pool. For senior engineers don't expect to move up the ladder past your initial hire level anytime soon. Perks are overrated, but if the bulk of your employees are young and relatively inexperienced these make a big difference to them especially outside of Seattle and makes it easy for other companies to attract and retain them. For senior staff the compensation and benefits are really starting to look stingy, and the lack of career mentoring and growth is just driving these guys away. Even if the junior staff are replaceable, you lose a couple of key senior roles and the whole team becomes crippled.  Amazon is now a huge company and its getting bigger every single day. Give up the fantasy that small agile teams can do whatever they need to get stuff across the line, because there are now 1000's of engineers working on some deliverables and the 2 interns who got assigned the task of building the foundation toolkit that everyone else now has to use just doesn't cut it. Processes and management need to adapt and either radically stem the tide of upward decision making or accept reality and own that process for what it is.",-5.649836,-4.558753,-0.034958169534215655,0.04739029970621671,3.0,0.13181084452270897,0.539523840095874

23934,amazon,2013,"Full time position and you do get benefits (although not good ones). Very high rates to meet (I work in sort, but have picked, tote wrangled and packed), low pay (started at 11/hr), very physical, favoritism, mandatory overtime often announced at the last minute.  Very hot and dusty environment. Allowed 30 mins. for lunch and two 15 min. breaks for a 10 hr. shift, but that means simply away from your station and or scanning. It takes several minutes to get to the break room and to get back to floor, so it's really a 20ish minute lunch and 10 minute (at best) breaks. If you go to the bathroom during work hours you are ""off task"" and can get in trouble and the few minutes going to the restroom greatly impacts your rate. Your rate drops every second you are not slaving away.  Amazon claims the customer is the most important thing, but its seems rates are. I do make rate regularly, mostly well over 100%, but it's very difficult, PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING. Such high rates, 10 hrs a day, 4 to 6 days a week on a concrete floor are physically very demanding and not very safe.  Quite a few people cut corners, the cherry pick and pass harder work to others and management doesn't do anything about it. Quality is overlooked for the sake of speed. Customers will get damaged goods or the wrong product, but they'd rather get the item out than ensure that it's in good condition and or the right item. I've seen many damaged items get passed down to the next step and the next, because it would take time to fix the problem. A lot of people just pass it down, instead of dealing with it. Or they damage it themselves in their haste and pass it on. The lazy ones who pass the buck and the cherry pickers make work much harder, and negatively impact the rates, for us with a good work ethic and who care about the customer.  No real opportunities to move up from warehouse associate. Can't move to another department, even if you're cross-trained without applying and interviewing as if you were a brand new associate. There are no such things as promotions at Amazon. Raises are a joke, 25 cents every six months, and not merit based.  Favoritism - some employees, who are friends of supervisors, or PAs at Amazon, are allowed to get away with hardly working and talking for a good part of the day and are given tasks that are easy and tasks that others would like to do (water spider for example), but they slack most of the time.

23945,amazon,2013,"While the Amazon mentality is con for others, it's a huge pro for me. My job is loosely defined and I received no formal training upon arrival. I love that. I had to be self-directed, find my own resources and create a niche in my team. My job can be what I make of it. I define my goals, propose projects, suggest changes to existing projects and choose to meet or exceed expectations. Helicopter bosses are not encouraged but I, as an individual contributor, have to do my part to prove that I can work autonomously. On a daily basis I have to find the data to prove my points before blindly making assumptions, write narratives to support my projects and define (and redefine) my goals. Speaking up with constructive solutions is consistently encouraged. The famous ""?"" email from Bezos, while intimidating, reminds us that everything is open for questioning and smart inquisition is encouraged. Amazon is the only company I've worked for that loudly and proudly displays its leadership competencies. In fact, almost everything I do can roll up into a particular leadership competency. Usually our actions are justified and rewarded in accordance with these core values. Finally, I love that we're encouraged to change positions every 18-24 months (lateral move or otherwise) so no one gets stuck in a single-minded rut. I had the fortune of being asked to move to a better role after just 6 months (a rare exception). Be prepared to work very hard. This isn't a con per se, but you should be mindful of that fact. I have worked 80 hours per week during heavy times and never less than 55 on any week. No one tells me to work this much, you have to figure out how much time it will take you to achieve your goals and do it. Also, don't expect ""perks"". Again, this isn't a huge con for me. I feel like people who go to work for ""perks"" aren't sincere. If you need rewards or praise for your work, you may not find it here. Finally, the autonomous mentality means that no one on your team is ever obligated to help you unless their manager tells them to. Help is hard to come by more than once so ask for favors wisely. Compensation is ""meh"" but opportunities are great. Also, if you stay long enough for all of your stocks to vest (like, minimum of five years), you'll have a nice little package of money eventually. I actually like our upper management. I sit a few feet from two VPs and they're very friendly to me. I wish that I knew more of their honest opinion about my work though. Their opinions tend to get filtered through my director, who dilutes the message. If there are concerns about my work, I always want it brought to my immediate attention but I don't always receive that because my director seems to be ""protecting"" me somehow.",0.01172653,-5.4738593,-0.020120056295339195,0.054490566743795744,4.0,0.21084951869835591,0.5726648351648351

There is always room for people to learn and grow. Amazon is a career accelerator. It is a trial by fire, but you will come away being a far better employable individual than you were before you set foot in the door.  Management is generally pretty good -- on an individual level at least.  The company is also insane as a whole. They make very strange trade-offs, which somehow end up working out for them (as noted with the market valuation of the company).  The people you work with are competent. Amazon has a very high interview bar, and it shows. You can trust that the person you're working with will do their job to the best of their ability, and they will challenge you in return. You gotta make sure you're up-to-date and on your toes, because anything that might be incorrect that you say or do will get challenged and brought to light. Amazon.com, LLC treats its employees probably the worst of any ""top-tier"" tech company. The number of truly useful benefits they have is small. Their claim that the cash you're making makes up for the lack of benefits is incorrect -- other companies are now paying more with better benefits.  You feel like the company doesn't care about you or your job. The attrition rate is so high that most teams lose about 50% of their talent every 2 years, so there's a lot of technical debt, and you risk finding yourself on a team whose only job is to clean up legacy code that nobody has touched since 2005 -- you don't get promoted that way, but someone has to do it.  The company wants to put all its engineers on-call. If you're not on-call, you're working to become on-call. There is little-to-no ops layer, such that they restrict when you can take vacation during the Christmas holiday. They will page you whenever they decide they need you, including if you're on vacation.  The likelihood that you'll get fed up with the company and decide to rage-quit after ~2 years is very high, don't plan on being at the company longer than that.  If you're a pregnant mother or expect to become a mother -- forget it, don't even consider this company. They demand too much of your time, and they will make you feel like you have to choose between your job and your baby.  Check the list of ""top tech companies to work for"" anytime from the beginning of time until now, you'll find that Amazon is rarely if never on that list, and there is a reason for it.

23960,amazon,2013,"The pay was competitive compared to other warehouses and minimum wage jobs in the area. A good place to work during the holidays if you just want extra cash. Physically demanding - If you are a picker, you are a told you will walk between 12-15 miles a day. I believe it is much more than that. I would say it is more like 20+.  Rates - Every picker is responsible for ""making rate"" before their shift ends. This means that you have to pick so many items an hour. This can be easy to obtain if you have a good pick path. If you have a difficult pick path, it can be hard to obtain. Management does understand that.  Time off task - Time off task is any time spent not working. As a picker, you have a scanner that monitors everything you do. If you are logged in and have not been scanning any items for an extended period of time, that is considered time off task. Time off task can happen for any reason. It can happen because you are moving from one pick area to the next, you are trying to find totes and carts, waiting on a problem solver, needing to go to the bathroom, etc. Again, management does not take these explanations into account when they ask you about why you have time off task.  Breaks - The breaks are too short for the type of work you are doing. There are two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. The 15 minute breaks are really 10 minutes. A person has to spend their last 5 minutes logging back into their scanner and getting to their work area. That is simply not enough for the type of physical work you are doing. After lunch (and before your shift begins), everyone meets at ""stand up"" to hear announcements, safety tips, and perform stretches. The stretches are not enough and are very outdated. They don't help much and sometimes the announcements can be repetitive.  Management - They only care about numbers.  Safety - Management puts a lot of stress on safety, but it doesn't really mean anything. If safety was important, we would be allowed to have more time to rest. The hours would also be shorter. Before you reach the end of your 10 hour shift, you will be tired and your level of awareness will decrease. Add that to the fact that you will be working 6 days a week with only one day off. Everyone is stressed out and tempers flare. If safety was important, Amazon would do what is necessary to make sure their employees stay alert and healthy while on the job.  Security - You have to go through security checks at least 3 times a day. You have to take off everything that might make the metal detector go off and put it in a small plastic box. If you make the metal detector go off, you are sent to another guard who will then do another check. Notice that you do not have to go through a metal detector to go in. It is only to leave. Amazon is afraid that you are stealing merchandise. They are not worried about the fact that a stressed employee might bring a weapon to work someday. Think about that for a second. I don't think a criminal would wake up at 5 am to be at work by 7 am to steal an iPad. Just sayin'.  Overall, this job is for people that don't think.

HD should be for data, not people. HD seating means developers no longer get their own cubicles, we have to sit in large bullpens that contain a dozen or more people. This is just terrible for both productivity and culture (everybody is too noisy, so productivity takes a major hit, but you also try to be considerate of your neighbors, so socializing takes a hit). They say this problem will go away when the new buildings start coming online later in 2014, but they really need to just rent more space now. At the rate Amazon is growing, those new buildings will fill up with HD seating just as soon as they're built.  On a similar note about Amazon's growth: it feels like we're in a phase of runaway personnel growth. This means we can't hire front-line managers fast enough to keep up with the development team expansion, and the development teams are getting to large for their managers to handle. Also there are a lot of fairly new managers who really don't know what they are doing. This is resulting in lots of developers not getting the help they need to further their careers.  Software testing is one of those areas that comes into political favor, and goes out again in a couple of years. In some departments, this means the QA teams get absorbed into the development teams (and then those people get assigned developer work and pagers). In other departments, this means that the QA team just doesn't get headcount expansion to cover new teams and team expansion. But the QA team is still expected to do some kind of coverage of these expanded and new teams. This means nobody is happy with the QA teams. Developers are frustrated because QA isn't keeping up, and is stalling releases. Development managers are put upon to provide more headcount for QA, or otherwise close the gap. QA is unhappy from being overworked and/or not getting the services covered. QA also doesn't have the bandwidth to do major process improvements that would improve their productivity.

24005,amazon,2013,"Amazon is a top-notch place to work if one is looking for myriad skills and experiences working in the world of e-commerce, not only for personal development but also as a resume builder. Additionally, they do maintain, in my opinion, a very clear and positive focus on creating ""the best possible customer experience"". That's a philosophy I could easily get behind. Also, Amazon encourages employees to move around a lot laterally, which means that if you don't like your role, it's always possible to find something else internally. Also, given the intensity of the work environment, people leave on a regular basis, creating openings for you ladder climbers out there. This depends largely on one's department, team, and job function, just as at any big company. But as far as I could tell, most employees are overworked, scrambling to keep their heads above water while maintaining high quality (a must to succeed at Amazon). Amazon is proud to be a ""lean"" organization, which means teams have little or no backup should key people go on vacation, become ill, or take some other form of leave. And it also means that everyone has, pretty much at all times, a mountain of work to climb. If you're looking for a job environment with an ebb and flow, Amazon isn't for you. Splurge a bit on team size to allow employees room to breathe and maintain their focus on quality output--I've seen people sleep in the office during key launches over the course of several weeks. This is never an acceptable environment. And employees should feel comfortable taking their vacations. Instead, I saw lots of anxiety about the work that would not get down because there's insufficient staffing to pick up any of the slack when people are out of office.

There's very few perks (no free lunches or frequent giveaways, for example) typical of tech companies, and chronic understaffing means employees often are forced to work long hours. - Internal employee tech support and troubleshooting is inconsistent at best, with quality of response and wait times varying wildly. - No one has the time or energy to hold your hand- although help is available, you have to be proactive in asking for it and knowing how to get the information you require for your job. You also have to be in charge of your own career development and networking- there are very few defined career paths and, again, no one is going to hold your hand. - I've heard promotions and raises are relatively rare compared to other companies, with much managerial hiring done externally.

Annual review process is political, confrontational and even hostile. Everyone is stack ranked. This is common in the industry but Amazon takes it to a new level. Other managers in your division are motivated to push you down the ranking scale to get their own employees higher up. They have incentive to trash you in the ranking meetings so you have to watch your back. There's high manager turnover so if you have a manager who is inexperienced at this process, you're at risk of being downgraded which happens quite often. They don't care much because they'll just higher many more brand new engineers. Nobody seems to care that the company is overwhelmingly staffed by relatively inexperienced engineers.

I want to let prospective employees know how very little it takes to get fired though, and how you may not even know it's coming.  --During interview and recruitment, I was told I would be on a 'chat' team to assist customers with technical issues via instant message. This was not true and I was assigned to a frontline phone support team-- a horrible assignment and definitely not one I would have left my former job for. I really doubt it was intentional but it certainly something they should have told me.  --They called me back a few days after the interview and asked if I could start two days later (!). I could not since I had been with my employer for about five years and wanted to give them two weeks of notice that I was leaving-- only fair since we had a great working relationship and they depended on me for many things. We're still friends outside of work. The recruiter agreed (or said they did, anyway) and rescheduled me for training so that I could give notice and I thought everything was looking good, until training started.  --A little over a week into training, a situation with family came up and I needed an hour of personal time-- I asked for the time and was told how to handle these requests. A couple of days later, I was contacted by my manager (which is pretty funny because didn't know I had one until then) and they wanted to talk about my attendance issues-- surprising since I didn't know I had done something wrong (I didn't say this, of course). About 10 minutes into this call, my manager brought in someone from HR as well. It was immediately clear to me that this was a well-versed routine and that they were trying to pressure me into quitting (which I wouldn't). With the HR person on the call, my manager went on the offensive and immediately asked me why I punched in precisely 20 minutes early every single day--- a really strange accusation since it's completely untrue-- I signed in and out exactly when I was supposed to and I still wonder where this question came from. Did my manager have the wrong person, or was it just an attempt to throw me off or provoke me? I'll probably never find out. We were told in the training that we had a window of approximately sixty seconds to punch in and out, which is really not enough time since we had to use an RSA token and PIN to sign into their VPN (a little device that gives you a code to sign into their network), then had to remotely connect to our desktops, then finally login into a time-keeping site and hit the 'punch clock' button. After that, you had 4 minutes left to sign into four different communication platforms (email, group chat, instant message, and their knowledge bank.  I can only imagine how many of the other trainees had similar experiences or worse... A shame since I was a huge fan of Amazon before I went through all this.

24130,amazon,2013,"Because of Amazon's rapid growth, career opportunities are almost endless, for those individuals starting at an FC, it's usually only a matter of months before the invitations to move to Seattle start. The company's legendary customer obsession is truly part of its DNA - managers will not think twice to drive a single package 35 miles to a UPS sort center to make a shipping cutoff - the employees genuinely care. Amazon hires incredibly smart people, and you'll learn more in 6 months there than several years at other employers. The caliber of regional managers at the corporate level is very high - the overwhelming majority take an active interest in your development and want you to succeed. Life at an FC is very different from the corporate Seattle experience - most FCs are only closed on Christmas Day, so almost every holiday (Memorial Day, Labor Day, July 4th, etc.) is typically a work day. Amazon's 24/7 schedule forces most managers to sleep by their cellphones, conference calls can occur at almost any time of day or night. Peak is a blur for FC employees - manager workdays span 16-18 hours a day and sometimes cross over the weekends - definitely an issue for families wanting a holiday with Mom or Dad. Amazon's culture is a little rougher than most large companies - ""constructive tension"" means that you need to feel comfortable going toe-to-toe with everyone from Area Managers to VPs if needed. While internal growth leads to promotion/transfer opportunities, it also creates a high level of open positions with work that needs to go somewhere. Relo benefits are lower than most companies - make sure you have a thorough understanding of the program and repayment period if you jump on board.

There is a wide discrepancy in programs and opportunities between Seattle and the FCs - while relo is an option, there has to be more support for those individuals unable to move due to family commitments or the high cost of the Seattle market.

24159,amazon,2013,"There are a few at Chattanooga who are right for their position. Some are in HR and some are managers. They take an interest in feedback and communicate well. Hired in one department but trained in others. All departments, inbound, stow, pick, sort, pack are judged by rate. In pick for example associates are to pick 100 items per hour in a 10 hour shift, in a 3 story pick area larger than a football field, regardless of the ridiculous pick path that is given to associates. The density of a pick path can very dramatically. If you make your 1000 items per shift you are left alone but fall below the 1000 per shift and be ready for punishment. Averages over several weeks are used to rate employees performance but be ready for verbal and written warnings if you don't meet their arbitrary goals. Managers say things will average out but that is not based on the reality of an actual associate. If you exceed rate per hour for months and months and then management changes things which causes your rate to drop you are pounced on. All that matters is rate at the expense of associates. Amazon has lost a lot of good people just because of the harassment by management and the physically brutal expectations of walking for 10 to 15 miles, or standing for 10 hours as a packer. Develop software to save associates from the brutality of walking 10 to 20 miles per shift. Stepping into another's shoes is a simple concept. We all understand it. But, how often do managers proactively practice it? Management needs to take on the jobs of their employees for one day to see what it is like. Don't just work for an hour or so - do the 10 hours. Next time you implement a change see what can you do to understand the associates point of view?

The first week of training you meet ~50 new managers and make some really good friends. Then 3 months later you attend ""Planet of the Ops"" and get to spend another fun week with the friends you made the first week. Overall it was a regrettable experience and only served to make me regret leaving my previous job and appreciate what I had before. From the beginning I was lied to about what to expect and told things that enticed me to join them. I had hoped working there was a great as being a customer. After you get through their intensive interview process, you will feel like it is a great place to be and that it is everything that you wanted in a job. After they moved me and started at my sight, I realized I had made a mistake. That was only within the first 3 weeks of being there. Associates and mangers are treated as numbers. Your input is not regarded in any decisions and you must accept whatever senior management wants. If you are a leader that cares about the people that work for you, this is not the place to be. Everyone is treated as if they are disposable. During my time there, I saw approximately 30 managers leave from various levels. That equated to an almost 30-40% loss in management. With the losses, no one was replaced and the work volume was dumped on those that remained. When new managers are brought on they send them to a one week training at another facility with 50 other managers to prepare for your new job. The week there is great, but it truly does not prepare you for the madness that is to come. Every week they have 50 new managers in that training. What does that tell you that they can hire 50 new managers every week and continue to always have open positions? They will say it is all the opening of new FC's and constant promotion to higher levels, but the reality is attrition. I asked specifically during my interview and that is the response I got. So if you have read all of this, be careful what you wish for, being employed there is not as great as being a customer. We are not all just numbers and rates to you.

24239,amazon,2013,"Very smart people. You will get to work with many high achievers from both the engineering and business worlds. Engineers get to learn a lot about business and see how high-achieving business managers function. Business managers get to work with and see how industry-leading engineering teams work. Ridiculously hard to get promoted. You're more likely to see incompetent managers get hired into positions that they don't want to promote you to. Performance reviews and compensation systems are set up to allow the company to work you harder and pay you as little as they can get away with. Basically, you will only get a promotion or a decent raise when you work so hard that management runs out of excuses not to reward you properly. Very top-down management style. Every engineer's goals are the result of his or her manager's business goals which are trickled down from the ""S-team"" - the top level VPs of the company, and so bottom and mid-level creative initiatives tend not to happen. Engineers have to deliver on project after project with overly aggressive deadlines, support a huge operational load (i.e. pagers going off in evenings and weekends), and are then held accountable for quality-related issues. Many teams with bloated mid-level managers who demand lots of meetings, book keeping, reporting etc. TPMs and Dev Managers have to depend on tribal knowledge and personal networking to get anything done.

Reviews are full of BS and are mostly written after ratings have been determined. Eventually, the only engineers with rewarding careers at Amazon tend to be the fortunate ones whose managers know how to game the system, rather than play along with it. Everybody else eventually leaves - burned out and under-appreciated. Shift the culture away from top-down, middle-management-heavy dynamics, and start fostering more focused and creative teams from below. Reward more. Promote more frequently from within.

24243,amazon,2013,"Great place for someone fresh out of school with no work experience and no realization of what a real work environment is supposed to be like. Great minds are at Amazon. Meet them before they burn out and leave. Build your professional network. They have relatively good benefits.  This is a great place to work if you’re one of those people that enjoy pushing your work off on others (also called “delegation”) and then claiming their success as your own. You will be recognized as a “leader” and be promoted despite your experience or lack of skills. Horrible place to work if you’re already established in your career, have a family, or enjoy unplugging from work long enough to enjoy your evenings, weekends, holidays or vacations. Amazon is not a family friendly company, despite what they say to the contrary. You’re penalized for working from home even if there is a legitimate reason even if you’re more productive there than at the office.  Amazon also holds onto the delusion that they are a start-up going after the big players in the market. They’re not. They are a mature “big player” company pretending to be start-up. All of the tools and data are home-grown, that translates into lots of bugs, inconsistent data, lack of a clear owner or desire by owners to maintain or fix their software/data, and catalog data that is lacking on details or consistency. This last point is important. If you’re the kind of person that loves making up data to suit your hypothesis, this is the place for you. If, however, you’re bugged by the inconsistencies you see from the same data sets but with different interpretations, you will be plagued with indecision and lack of confidence on a daily basis.  Be prepared during your tenure to have your self-confidence and self-esteem battered on a daily basis. The position you’re applying for now will not be the same one you’ll be performing on a daily basis. You will be doing menial tasks daily, predominantly data entry, data validation, report generation and ticket resolution (and that’s if you’re a business owner like a vendor manager or product manager). In any given week, you’ll have about 8 hours total that you’ll be able to devote to your actual job, though you can easily do 40 hours a week if you work evenings and weekends.  Amazon’s strategy for attracting the best and the brightest is to hire in the cream of the crop from colleges around the country, suck the creative juices and ideas out of their employees, then toss them aside with no clear path to career succession while they go ply the universities for other unsuspecting candidates. Their restricted stock plan is designed in such a way that you get trivially small amounts of stock in your first two years before it balloons for another two years. They do this because most people that go to Amazon leave or get fired between the first and second year.  Competition is fierce at Amazon. Not just between Amazon and the outside world, or between the various Amazon teams, but within your own team. You will be forced to compete in terms of your effectiveness or production rate with your co-workers and you will be publically called out for not achieving arbitrary goals. The definition of “productive” is also a very arbitrary term at Amazon. You can have someone that does the bare minimum, who gets others to fix the problems they cause and who claim credit for work others did get called an “effective leader” and get promoted. You also get folks that work hard, long hours, usually 10 or 12 hours a day, late into the night, on weekends and holidays, who don’t take vacation, who then get fired within their first year because they weren’t “productive” enough.  Amazon is highly fractured internally, with each group given a set of goals to achieve that are not aligned at the corporate level. The result is that you have groups duplicating the work of others, building solutions that solve their immediate need but create more work or disrupt business processes for others, and management groups often make poor business decisions because the mid-tier managers tend to only talk about the wins, not about the blockers or issues. Amazon, as a whole, is highly dis-functional whose mandate of becoming the largest online seller of “stuff” in the world has certainly made them successful externally, but has created a huge list of issues and process misses internally. Unless major amounts of resources are devoted to resolving the business processes and data integrity issues within the next few years, Amazon will see an increase in employee satisfaction, and higher costs of doing business (due to hiring in people to maintain antiquated data schemas and coding band-aid solutions rather than scraping the entire system for something much more scalable and less prone to bug defects).  If you do get hired, you will have a significant ramp-up period on the order of six to nine months. Nothing is well documented at Amazon, despite their assertion that the Wiki has the information you need (which was true when they created the page two years ago but doesn’t reflect the actual state of affairs today), so you will have to train yourself on how to use the tools or from your co-workers if you’re lucky enough they can pull themselves away from their data processing long enough to help you.

24271,amazon,2013,"-Awesome coworkers, They keep a really high bar, at least for SDEs. Ownership is a real thing, not just management-speak. Every SDE gets to own the entire service/product and has insight and input into every step - requirements gathering, design, development, deploy and maintainance. This is particularly true in new or relatively young services. Each service is also independent of each other. In most aspects, this leads to a startup culture within the big organization. At the same time, being a large organization allows great shared platforms and technologies to be used by all the mini-startups within the company. Lots of management hires from outside the company recently, a recent trend is to crowd out engineers out of meetings. Not sure how it is going to impact the culture long term.  Another big con is the compensation. Performance reviews and compensation revisions don't go hand-in-hand. Compensation change follows a really opaque process, with the end result being most pay hikes are paltry, even with great perf review scores. Only saving grace is the stock grant you get on joining and vests over 4 years. That is why so many people leave after 4 years - there is big drop in effective comp at the end of 4 years. In short, if you are joining Amazon, remember that you are basically negotiating salary for 4 years, not just the first year.

24309,amazon,2013,"Job security: In this economy, job security is a precious commodity. If you can get hired on full time, you have to try hard to get fired. Production quota seems hard to meet at first, but once you're familiar with the process it gets much easier to make rate. Their attendance policy is hands-down the most lenient I've ever seen. Because they use an attendance points system, if you manage it right, you can come and go as you please. If you want to leave early or take a day off simply because you feel like it, you can do that without any retribution.  Benefits: The health insurance is mediocre, but all other benefits are far better. You get free life insurance, free accidental death and dismemberment insurance, free short term/long term disability insurance (which saved my bacon when I was out on medical leave), tuition reimbursement, and $1200 worth of stocks each year.  Co-workers: I've met a lot of great people during my five years at Amazon. You'll have no trouble making new friends.  As a business I have a great deal of respect for Amazon. I've met Jeff Bezos. He's a good guy. A few years ago, he visited our facility for a few days and spent a full shift working in a process. That says something about the man who signs our paychecks. Unfortunately, though I respect Amazon a great deal, I don't think Bezos has any idea what really happens on the floor of his fulfillment centers. So here's a breakdown:  Moral: The atmosphere has become extremely negative. We used to be encouraged to talk to our co-workers while on the floor (as long as we stayed productive), because it was good for morale. As morale was boosted, so was productivity. Now, the attitude is if you're talking, you're not working hard enough. If we don't keep our head down, eyes front, and mouths closed, we get ""coached"" about work ethic. We also used to be encouraged to give feedback to our managers. Managers called it an ""open door policy."" After all, there is no better expert of a particular process than the people doing it all day. That philosophy worked, too. But that changed. Now everything's micromanaged by middle management, and any feedback, no matter how constructive, is treated like an attitude problem.  Workload: At first glance, the work doesn't seem hard. But that's deceptive. Labor hours have been reduced to a skeleton crew. Few people in certain roles are pushed past their physical limit, resulting in injuries. And if you get hurt on the job, they report it as a non work related injury, even though it isn't. Thus, not only are you disqualified from Workman's Comp, but they can also fire you, and keep saying on record how safe they are.  Pay: They say competitive pay, but they don't tell you that they're comparing you with general retail jobs such as JCPenny, Sears, and Wal-Mart, although it's a warehouse job. They don't compare our pay to other warehouse jobs or distribution centers (ie. Meijer Distribution, CostCo, etc.) because they're all union jobs with excellent pay.  Opportunity for growth: If you aren't a military officer, there is no opportunity for growth. There is one promotion you can earn, after that, that's it. Area managers and above are hired from outside, usually from the military, and anyone applying for a promotion are told they're not qualified, in spite of their degrees, years of experience, and expertise of the process. They tell you what you need, only to move the goal post the next time you apply.  Work-life balance: There is none. It's that simple. I come home from a ten (sometimes twelve) hour shift too tired to eat dinner. That's not an exaggeration. My daily life is: get up, go to work, come home, pass out on top of my covers on my bed with my clothes still on. Sometimes, I have to settle for the couch, as the stairs prove too much of an obstacle. That's not a rant, my roommate made fun of me about that the other day.  All in all, after five years there, I'm pretty miserable. It's a good short term job, especially during the holiday season, but don't make a career out of it.

24327,amazon,2013,"The best part about Amazon is its focus on ownership. You really have the opportunity to contribute to your project, and in more ways than just ""here's the feature, code it up"". You get to think of how you want to improve the project and are encouraged to do so in anyway you can.  There's not much to say about compensation and benefits. They're around average, but I still list it as a pro.  Free snacks in the kitchen. I can't imagine having less work-life balance.  We don't get sick days, so when you get sick you come in to work and give whatever you have to everyone else (and they return the favor, hooray!). They don't bother mentioning it in the offer, so it comes as a pretty big shock when you get sick - ""Oh, by the way we're the only major company ever to not offer sick days."" Of course you can take some of your very limited vacation days instead if you want (that is, if you even have any saved up).  Another perk they don't tell you about: being on call. They don't have Ops teams here and barely have Customer Service, so as an SDE you get to play both. Getting paged at 3am for issues beyond your control is not a lot of fun, and neither is responding to customer issues all day with ""this behavior is expected"".

24329,amazon,2013,"Its been 18 months since my last review, and since then I feel that things have been improving. Amazon started coaching managers in how to do the associate's jobs, and that has made it easier for them to understand problems and help make solutions. Our management in the areas of outbound where I work has been great and they have been very easy to get along with. I have been employed for nearly 5 years now and it seems that in the last year and a half more emphasis has been placed on quality and safety than in years before.  There has also been a more postive outlook among the associates in my area, which has made working here more enjoyable. (Or at least they are not complaining as much?) The worst thing about this job is the constant management turnover. As soon as you get used to somebody they are gone. I understand that they want to move on up, but for some reason they have to go to another facility to do that, when that particular job opportunity is also opening up in same facility. It doesn't make any sense. They also have a bad habit of hiring outside the facility and not promoting from within as much as they should. I don't know if there is some sort of quota the facilites have to go by, but plenty of associates have applied for tier 3 jobs only to have another employee from another facility get the job.  This last peak season we had issues with filling hiring slots. Amazon has been in our town long enough for the whole place to know what it is like to work here. I have heard from people ""on the street"" ask me what is going on over there, as they know people who have worked here and they do not want to go back. Every time it has been about the picking department. They all say the same thing, ""we feel that we are set up to fail"". Until the pick department takes care of this problem the hiring for peak may get worse and worse. The associates who work in the facility do not like to go to pick, and it has been like this for the 5 years I have been there. I have read the VOA board and their has yet to be any solutions for the problems with the department. This would be more for the company: PLEASE take care of your area managers, Ops, Senior Ops, and everyone else in tier three.

24341,amazon,2013,"Amazon is a well known, and well liked company -- they actually do care about customers -- and take customer trust and experience very seriously. Different groups and teams are reasonably decoupled, allowing a lot more independence.  If you're the sort of person that likes to work on lots of different bits of software, and constantly jump from fire to fire, it's definitely a better fit than someone who prefers quality.  Amazon also copes very well with the high-level of turn-over by making sure that exposing a lot of people to a lot of things -- to keep employees fungible. Amazon makes no absolutely effort to attract high-quality people (in fact, they do quite the opposite with their self-claimed 'frugal' -- absolutely-under-no-circumstances-any-benefits policies).  When Amazon tells you about 'Work Hard', what they mean is that they make work hard. Like all the stuff you're expecting: a powerful developer machine, or a second monitor, are things Amazon has a policy against (Although, as they will tell you -- you're allowed to buy and bring in your own stuff like RAM, SSDs and Extra-Monitors ... lucky you!).  And what about Admin access on your developer laptop? LOL no, that would make life easy. To be approved for that, you need to be literally 4 levels up from the bottom! Root access on your Desktop? Nah, but they'll give you sudo, but you can't actually use your desktop for development -- you'll have to work through a VM. And to make sure you don't enjoy it, your development VM will be some ancient Red Hat image, with absolutely nothing newer than 5 years old (literally!). Just in case you ever want to google something, all the libraries/function/features made in the last half-decade won't work.  The internal systems at Amazon are so painful, that I suspect that a large percentage of employees after a hard-days work, come home and put needles in their arms for fun. When stuff works, its slow and largely unusable, and a dozen times worse than any freeware you'll find on the internet. The source control, build systems and all other developer tools seem like it was developed by a retarded monkey after he drank too much that night. Apparently they're now working on an ""internal github, that works on more SCS than just git -- and has an awesome advanced security model"". I wonder why they don't try get their page-load times under 10 seconds first.  Even things that you thought were solved 20 years ago, Amazon manages to break with their own special flavor of retardedness. Like the mailing lists. It's an accepted fact, that it's impossible to *reliably* filter a message to a folder, because the send is not from the mailing list -- there is no mailing list header, and no required subject prefix! Another great joy is, after sending a message to a mailing list, your inbox will lag for *literally* the next 5 minutes, as you get spammed by ""Out of Office"" replies. But no one excepts the Amazon workplace to be functional or enjoyable, so this is just the normal.  And of course, then there's the bureaucracy. At first, you'll try fight it, and try do what's best for the company. But soon you'll realize, like half the company is nothing but paper-pushers -- and you can easily waste a month just trying to get approval for some trivial thing. In the end, you'll be a lot happier here if you treat it as a job, don't try fight it, don't try enjoy it, put in your hours and leave at the end of the day (hoping your pager doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night, over some stupid issue) none",1.4613829,-10.381544,-0.012990169799705693,0.09489674910165947,1.0,0.15010393046107334,0.47834152179390277

It is quite cool to work on exciting technology and see the results impacting the world...and at high speed. Well, employees are not what Amazon cares about. Period!  There are too many things to list here when you compare with other technology companies: lower than industry package, very slow/hard promotion process, many bad managers who care little about employees (the only way to be a ""good"" manager there), very stressful work environment, work-life balance is non-existence... Employee turn-over is very very high. Very few employees stay more than four years. On top of that, the hiring bar is extremely high. No wonder there are never enough people to do the increasing amount of work.  Two things are particularly stupid: - Your review pay increase is limited by your previous stock grants! If you have many previous stock grants, either from your sign-on bonus or previous review grants, during employee performance review you could get _zero_ increase even if you did an excellent job that year. The company thinks you are compensated enough! It seems they are afraid of employees making too much and ensure that won't happen.  - If you are an entry level engineer who need a greencard sponsor, stop join Amazon. The company won't sponsor low level employees until they are promoted to next level. PhD does not matter! That is 3 to 4 years delay in the greencard process. That is a huge deal for foreign origin employees. Many new engineers just left once they found out that.

24421,amazon,2013,"-Overtime -Work 4 days and 10 hours a week. -Stock opportunity -Unfair management -Favoritism at an all time high -Management and employee turnover at an all time high as well  -Associates aren't allowed to fully enjoy their breaks and lunches due to their travel time being included in their break time. For instance, if you start walking towards the break room at 9:30, and you get to the break room and sit down at 9:33, that travel time is added against your break time.  -Communication issues between management -Micromanaging -EVERY MAN FOR THEMSELVES  -Managers and HRSB's often harp about there being an ""open door policy"" and a voice of the associate board for associates who wish to voice their suggestions, comments, and questions, which often goes unacknowledged because they selectively read what they want and respond how they want. If it's something that isn't complimenting THEM or anything positive about the job in general, don't count on for a response from them. If most of the comments are negative, then they will only suggest for the associate with the issue to come to their office or report it to an immediate manager at any time so that it can be properly addressed, which rarely happens. -Seeing as how the turnover rate for this employer is ridiculously high, I guess it wouldn't make sense to waste time and money training new and/or relatively seasoned employees in multiple functions.  -The first few years of the Amazon - Whitestown IND1 opening went really well because of the consistent record -breaking of units processed. Good management and incentives played a role in that until the GM decided it would be a great idea to swap them out for new management and things took a turn for the worse. Micromanaging and little to no incentives played a role in how the customers were always receiving wrong items, how employees were overworked and making a lot of mistakes, and how coachings, first/second/written warnings are second nature if an associate isn't performing 100% or better. Like for instance, an associate can and will be written up even if they're at a 99 percent for the week. Take a look at how associates did the first years of Amazon opening, then take a look at how things are going now. It goes back on how things were managed, not the associate. If termination should take place, it should start with the managers.  -Hire managers that actually HAVE good interpersonal skills and have actually dealt with people instead of hiring fresh young faces that are seconds out of college with little to no management experience. Amazon is too big of a warehouse for anyone new to handle that big of a responsibility. I understand that you have to start somewhere, but Amazon is NOT the place.  -In order to have a happy customer, you have to have a happy employee. Make sure you treat your employees well, and by well, I mean actually making sure they have their FULL 15 minute breaks and full 30 minute lunch.  When you have money hungry managers that are very customer centric and only care about numbers, you're bound to see a downfall somewhere, usually in productivity and attendance. You're overworking your employees and they usually have nothing to show for it. There's a lot of money put in your pockets from overworking your employees, and what are your employees getting? $5 gas cards or a gift card to a place they don't even shop at or never knew existed until after the fact.  -Stop berating your employees like children when mistakes are made and customers are receiving the wrong items due to carelessness, fatigue, and your unrealistic demands that you won't admit to. It all starts from YOU guys and how well you treat your associates. When you start treating your associates better, I can guarantee you will see a much better result.  -Don't think that just because you're manager and you have a title, that you are always right and have no room for criticism as well as improvement.  -Communication between managers is bad. Very bad, which is why the ""open door policy"" and VOA board is such a bust [let's not forget flawed] because they don't properly address the comments, suggestions, and concerns that need answers. I find it odd that communication between them is bad, yet they will bend over backwards to make sure they deliver a coaching, first/second/final written warning to an associate with the quickness, but will take days to address an associate's need. You can't be that busy if all you're doing is looking at spreadsheets.  HR is not your friend if you're an employee. They are only there to defend the employer, not you. Unless you're being threatened, sexually harassed, or being discriminated against, then don't count on HR for anything should you seek ""assistance"" [or lack thereof] from any of them.  -The rating system is flawed, but they will never admit it. They expect you to process X amount of units per hour even when bin space becomes limited, but will still hold you to that standard because the senior OPS manager needs to see that the ops manager is seeing into the area manager taking appropriate action on the associate not being 100% or better to make them look good.

24460,amazon,2013,"Good pay, talented & fun coworkers, flexible hours, work from home, wide selection of food trucks at lunch time This was a developer position, and I barely got the opportunity to program, and when I did it was mind numbingly trivial. I worked in Retail Systems, and they are mostly bogged down in trouble tickets and constant feature requests from the business side, leaving little time to actually develop software. Furthermore, the paranoia about losing money leads to aversion toward software change, which means the code-base is a monstrous pile of incremental changes accumulated over the years. Almost no documentation, and I frequently would hear sentiments that documentation or comments would be a hindrance-- since that would mean having to maintain the documentation or comments in parallel with the code (this might have just been a cultural aspect of my team). There seems to be a revolving door for young developers, as well as people jumping around from team to team, so teams' know-how deteriorates to the point where there are large portions of code that no one is familiar with. And yet, you have to support that code when you are on-call. If you aren't familiar with on-call, it means getting paged at any time of day when there are problems with the software. You might be thrown into a scenario where you are responsible for Amazon ordering being down, and the problem lies in your team's software, but you aren't familiar with that part of the code. You will probably just have to relay this to your team members-- which is fine-- but needless to say it is stressful.  I was promised to eventually get the chance to do some real software development, but perhaps not for a year or more. If you are in it for the long haul, maybe it could be okay. I didn't care about the money, and it didn't make it worth letting my career stagnate for 2-3 years waiting until I was senior enough to do maybe have the chance to do some real work. Slow down feature requests, and realize that technical debt and software cruft are a serious detriment to the companies future, and drives away talent who would prefer to design and innovate in a way which would secure a better future for the company.

You will get very little sleep. All manner of abuse of employees is justified on the basis of Customer Obsession (employees are not treated as 'customers'). - Software quality is often sacrificed by managers to meet deadlines and blame for failures placed on engineers (so the only way for a SDE to deal with a sev-2 is to kiss that long weekend goodbye and at least show you are working on the problem). - Turnover rates in some groups are very very bad, particularly some platform teams. Managers last less than six to twelve months (these folks typically leave Amazon because you can't transfer internally before 12 months are over). If you are an SDE, forget about stability and continuity. - As AWS becomes successful, the platform teams are getting political at the manager/sr. manager levels. The organization runs on fear.

It's less of an issue at the SDE level. - Expect to beg for productivity software and decent quality laptops/computer peripherals (or buy your own).

Maintain a flat org structure like Google. - Hire managers who write code around 10% of their job (these type of people tend to spend less time playing political games). - Give developers some breathing room to be creative, and work on hobby projects to expand their horizons. - Create dedicated operations teams to reduce oncall burden. - Don't overwork engineers and managers and tell them they are fortunate to be working for a company like AWS.

While we're at it, micromanagement eats this place from within. Software devs are made to commit to unrealistic deadlines while executing the project exactly the way the czar wants it.  But it can always be worse. Under a mercenary manager, micromanagement will be the least of your worries. Try to come up with ideas they don't like and you must produce data to support your case.

They can even train easily other people to do that junk stuff. 3) Oncall burden. Its very bad for an engineer to wake up in the mod night and work on tickets. 4) No career growth.

I have seen instances where they are hiring the people who doesn't know how to code properly. This is because the managers want to project their growth by completing the projects on time(by compromising the hiring the bar). 8) Frugality at Peaks. 9) Crammed workspaces.

And then it will be transferred to India for maintenance and adding small features. 12) People are working here only to get the brand. 13) No work life balance. 14) No team outings 15) SDEs rarely gets transferred to Seattle. 16) In India, Amazon has lost its significance.

Too high a risk  # 2 -> Be ready to be micromanaged  Jeff Bezos is a infamous micromanager. 90% of managers in Amazon micromanage. You will be told what to do - including fonts in word documents, type of excel to create, what type of comments to provide  # 3 -> Nobody will care for you  HR is non-existent in this company. Leadership principles are a big hoax. Only on paper, none followed. Managers interested only in furthering their own careers. No meaningful career discussions possible  # 4 - > Career levels -> You will be below the ones that joined out of campus or stayed many years in Amazon by a drastic margin  Career Levels in Amazon are: Level 4: SDE - 1 Level 5: SDE - 2, TPM, Manager - II, Product Manager Level 6: SDE - 3, Sr Engineer, TPM-III, Manager-III, Sr Product Manager Level 7: Principal Engineer, Principal TPM, Senior Manager - Software Dev, Senior Manager - Product Management (They will camouflage this in the external market as ""General Manager"" to hoodwink ppl) Level 8: Director Level 10: VP (There is no level 9) Level 11: SVP Level 12, Bezos (CEO)  For internal campus hires Level 4 - usually a SDE stays 2-3 years before making to Level - 5 Level 5- Level 5 to 6 is tough and can take upto 3-5 years. level 6 to 7 is also 3-5 years  For external hires (outsiders) Level 4: Folks with less than 4 years work ex OR with salary lower than max band of Level 4 will come here Level 5: Folks with salary less than max of Level 5 OR with upto 9-10 years are hired here Level 6: Folks with less than 15-16 years are hired here Level 7: need 15+  So net-net if you are at level 6 outsider - you could be director at Travelocity while a campus hire can be there within 5 years VERY bad for outsiders  A director at Yahoo may join at Level 7 and report to a joker with no ppl manager skills 10 years younger to him. (Associates team in Bangalore is one such team - worst to work for)  # 5: Pay  They design pay with base pay + sign on Sign-on is for first year and second year - it is a trick to ensure you run on treadmill for 2 years and your salary at beginning of 3rd year can be less than the first year if you are not promoted  # 6: Recruiters lie Due to high hiring bar and bar raiser interviews, they reject most that interview. This means recruiters are under tremendous pressure to get candidates in. Some positions are open for 6-12 months and finaly moved back to Seattle. So recruiters lie left, right and center to get candidates in. Don't trust the recruiter  #7: Lack of social etiquette It is Amazon's official line that since ppl are overworked they don't socialize and develop social etiquette. Typical Amazon manager (those who grow from within) are abrasive  Net-net bad place to join for anyone experienced. Risks outweigh benefits.

I've worked for some top companies, and I've not seen customer focus like in Amazon. * Pays slightly better in cash than other similar companies, this comparison falls flat if you bring in other benefits into the picture (Amazon has nothing there) * If you like rapid changes and find excitement in firefighting, you'll like the work in most teams * Absolutely no work-life balance. You are basically expected to work weekends often, and it is assumed that you will join late night calls every day. * On Call. If you're interviewing with them, ask them about it. They generally don't mention it to you till you've joined. Your mobile number is entered into the system, and anytime there is an issue in production, you will get a message and you are expected to login and take a look within 15 mins. This could happen anytime while you are on-call, 3am or when you are with friends on weekends... Oh, they'll give you a datacard though, so you can carry your laptop wherever you go and login and work when they ask you to. One thing that makes it slightly better is that the team takes it in turns, so you are on-call about one week every month (will vary by team size and other factors). * Absolutely no respect for personal space. I was called 8 times from office (about work) when I had explicitly told them I was out of office attending a funeral. When my friend's dad was hospitalized, he was asked to send a report within an hour, despite the fact that he was in the hospital with his father. * Minimal benefits. Amazon takes frugality to an extreme. If you even make the mistake of joining there, ""Frugality"" is one of the core principles/values that they will advertise during your new employee orientation, and you will hear this word a LOT during your stay at Amazon. * A minor gripe - their stock vesting cycle is designed that you lost a lot of stock whenever you leave the company. Here's what you get after completing: 1 year - 5% 2 years - 15% 2.5 yrs - 20% 3 years - 20% 3.5 yrs - 20% 4 years - 20% So anytime you leave, you lose all stock awarded within the last 1 year, 95% of the stock awarded between 1yr and 2yrs ago, 80% of the stock awarded between 2yrs and 2.5yrs ago and so on.

There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.

You may spend years hearing praise for the work you do, but it's never backed up with promotions. Also, this is not a good place to work if you are at all introverted, value family life more than work life, or prefer to work a normal person's schedule. If you are in a non-technical role, you also have little chance of seeing any kind of career advancement. Large divide in pay between people on the same teams and little transparency into the payment and growth processes.  Additionally, most employees share a highly liberal political stance, which drives the culture in a mostly positive way, but it also requires that everyone agrees with the mindset. Those that have differing values can expect to feel ostracized.  Finally, the treatment of vendors and contractors (including facilities staff, janitors, kitchen staff, security guards, and receptionists, among others) by employees can be staggeringly disappointing, embarrassing, and offensive.

Young, energetic, and ambitious - it’s very exciting to be part of. - Work on great products that you see everyone using. Know that you played a huge part in making that happen. - Empowered. Immediately put into roles and positions where you have to make big decisions (multi-million dollar) that impact the company and end users. - Lean in places. Very fast paced and not a lot of formal processes. Ability to make decisions quick without having to go through tons of redtape. - Fantastic cafeteria at very reasonable prices. Plus, free Apples. - Great on a resume and recruiters constantly contact you because you work at Apple. When you leave you go to Amazon/Square/Nest/Google etc. - Good discounts on products for personal and friends/family. Get stuff for yourself too. - Okay compensation (salary, bonus, and stock). - International travel is on business class and stay at 5-star hotels (Grand Hyatt, JW Marriot etc. with good daily food budgets). Get to keep those airline/hotel points and travel for free on vacations. - On-site Concierge, ergonomics experts, laundry service, free dinner. - “Beer Bash” every couple weeks. Free beer/appetizers in the quad while a top band plays live. - Wear whatever you want to. Some people come dressed as Ninjas or wizards. - Good shuttle service to many locations in the SF Bay with free Wifi. - Extremely high burnout rate. Some products have teams where the overwhelming majority of people (>60%) have been at the company less than 3 years (high turnover). Hearing that someone has been at Apple for 5 years is rare and garners respect/admiration. - Zero work-life balance. Expect to work until late every night and then be “on-call” to answer emails/calls at any hour. If in Operations, expect to work both California and Asia working hours in the same day (9am-1am). - Travel a lot to be on-site. Essential but draining. When you fly overseas, it’s expected that you land in the morning so you can work the second you get there. When you fly home, it’s expected that you take a flight to land in SFO at 8am so you can be at work that day. Also, common for last minute travel. Had a couple instances of getting a call on Saturday and was on a flight to Asia on Sunday. Stay there until job is done. - 90 days a calendar year is the limit to be in a certain Asian country for business purposes. “Strongly recommended” that employees apply for a work-permit/visa so that you can stay there longer. - Extremely fast paced. Very common to get an email/text on a Sunday afternoon and it’s expected that you have a presentation done and sent by dinner time (Sunday night Pacific time is Monday morning in Asia). - Working with Asia means getting calls at all hours. - Lots of politics between teams/orgs. Some teams (Industrial Design and Product Design especially) are higher in the totem pole and treat the other teams with annoyance (at best) to belittlement (“Just get it f***ing done, Engineering PMs! I don’t care about supplier capabilities.”). Look into attrition. Tons of people leaving.

It's an amazing bullet point on your resume - opens up doors that may not be otherwise open. If you are in the right group, you can bank on stock, bonuses and other perks. Also, depending on the group, there are a ton of extremely brilliant and dedicated employees that foster a phenomenal collaborative culture. A few years at Apple can change the overall trajectory of your career. If you can hang at Apple, you can make it anywhere else. If you find the right group, it could quite possibly be the best place to work. So, do your homework on the group you are joining (stay away from IS&T).  Lastly, telling people you work at Apple always gets a lot of attention - the brand recognition is amazing. As with any company, there are parts of it that are amazing, and then parts that are not as amazing. IS&T falls in the 'not so amazing' category. Employee development is mediocre at best, pay is lacking and the charm of stock is elusive. There are a lot of fiefdoms, a lot of obscure politics, and parts of the organization lack the Apple culture that you would expect or hear while on the outside. A director, having come from another bay area company, had hired others within management from the same bay area company. There seemed to be quite a bit of favoritism within this clique - didn't look like people moved up the ladder if they weren't a part of the clique.  Working from home is generally frowned upon and discouraged. The occasional working from home is ok but the expectatation is that you are in the office (why else would you build a multi-billion dollar HQ?).  IS&T heavily relies on outsourced vendors to do the heavy lifting and this can grow frustrating as you spend most of your time interacting with non-Apple employees. As a result of this, the diversity is lacking and there is an endless line of replaceable Indian resources. It's very impersonal at times - if you don't like one of them, pick another, like a box of infinite tissues. Constantly working with replaceable resources prevents one from developing any meaningful working relationships. There are stretches where you hardly interact with other 'badged' Apple employees. Many in management have moved over to Apple from one of these vendors, and bring with them a different work culture which at times takes away from the Apple culture. Apparently, it's ok for customers to email Tim Cook, or Steve Jobs when he was around, but god forbid that an employee emails an executives admin (not even an executive, but their admin) inquiring about the most benign of things. Hell shall break loose, and you will forever be marked as ""that guy"". All of a sudden, the backside of the fence doesn't seem to be painted as nicely as the front side.  Performance reviews are an absolute joke. If you are too technical and lack the business/management aspects they will tell you that you need to grow your business acumen and management capabilities. If your strengths are management but you lack technical skills, they will tell you that you need to strengthen your technical skills. Needless to say, there is next to no process in place, or employee development to help you grow in whatever area they think you need focus on. This is just a tactic - draw attention to your weaknesses then provide no means to improve them, thus justifying your paltry merit increase. While you are told you will get a bonus, additional stock - if you aren't in the right group or have the right 'people managers' batting for you, you are screwed. Many in management have no business being managers as they do absolutely nothing to help those under them grow professionally. At the end of the day, it's an attitude of 'be grateful, you work for Apple'...unfortunately, this just isn't enough justification to stick around long term for some.  IS&T also has this extremely poor and chaotic funding process for capital projects. It may have worked very smoothly when Apple was much smaller, but it does not scale well at all and creates absolute mayhem. It's a process that begs the need for a six sigma type approach to correct it, or get a bunch of consultants (real consultants, not offshore) in there to help streamline it. Many of the challenges they face, such as a diluted culture resulting from an overabundance of offshore resources can be directly attributed to a poor planning and funding process. Also, projects that are deemed 'sexy' are the ones that get approved, the ones that are on senior managements presentations, and the ones that you have to be a part of to really get any recognition. If you are on an 'operational' project', even those that are business critical, and it's not a 'sexy' project - you will more than likely be sidelined when it comes to merit increases/performance reviews. Grow your employees, or they will outgrow you and move on and you will be left looking at a sea of outsourced resources who don't 'think different'.  Don't become a bureaucratic and disjointed organization by creating artificial layers of management who are there to protect their fiefdoms. Apple is Apple because they think different. The day you stifle that spirit is the day you may as well outsource it all because you have ceased to 'think different', ceased to 'stay hungry, stay foolish... .’, and ceased to be Apple....",-8.771556,-3.795283,-0.04959780981725491,0.03459679529206348,3.0,0.17090076590076586,0.5567661505161505

Unheard of in retail! Health care, transportation benefits, free services, stock purchase plan. Easy access employee website. Lost sight of their core value ""our core is our people"" I started working at Apple in 2007 and boy have things changed! It has gotten more and more corporate and more and more dehumanizing focusing more on policies and proceedures than the wellbeing of the employees. The daily foot traffic in the store is immense! The climate can be very emotionally overwhelming, loud, and overly stimulating...yeah you are probably thinking I am some sensitive shmuck! But the daily traffic gets overwhelming when you are responsible for dealing with angry customers daily in an environment where you have little support! Managers are inconsistent in implementing company policy, constantly making exceptions for customers who scream and disrespect employees. THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH EMPLOYEES ON THE FLOOR!! BUT MANAGEMENT EXPECTS US TO HELP 4-6 PEOPLE AT ONCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT. LASTLY, moving up in the company is extremely difficult! there are many lateral promotions that warrant no pay raise, but managers are extremely inconsistent in their reasoning for promoting people. You could have perfect numbers and attendence but they will give the promotion to someone who has worse numbers but just sucks up to them more and they will give you a lame reason such as ""we think you need to work on your peer to peer relationships"" (happened to several of my co-workers) THERE ARE NO REAL BEARRINGS FOR PROMOTIONS. AND MOST ""PROMOTIONS"" ARE LATERAL AND ALLOW YOU TO WORK HARDER AND DO MORE IN THE STORE WITHOUT GETTING PAID A CENT MORE...THEY HAVE A REALLY WONDERFUL WAY OF TRICKING YOU INTO FEELING LIKE YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL AND HAPPY THEY GRANTED YOU WITH THIS OPORTUNITY!!!

MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY WHEN THEY TOLD YOU TO UPHOLD COMPANY POLICY! IT CAN BE HARD TO KEEP SMILING! BUT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS AN EXCEPTION MADE FOR THEM???OOOOHHHH NOOOOO....THE POLICY IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THEN!!! They say they want to give you more personal development training time but you have to FIGHT for it!  ONE MORE THING! The corporate availability requirements! you are forced to give 29 hours of open availability and they can ether give you 5 hours a week or the full 29....you cannot request to work more or less. THEY ARE SEVERELY INCONSIDERATE AND UNFLEXIBLE ABOUT PERSONAL AND FAMILY EMERGENCIES! IF YOUR GRANDMA DIES AND YOU CANT GET YOUR SHIFT COVERED IN TIME OH WELL! YOU WILL RECIEVE AN ATTENDENCE POINT EVEN IF YOU NOTIFIY THEM A WEEK IN ADVANCE! EVERYTHING IS DONE BY A COMPUTER...ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT HAS OVERRIDING POWERS THEY WILL SELDOM MAKE EXCEPTIONS AND JUST SAY ""SORRY THE COMPUTER ALREADY SCHEDULED YOU...I HOPE YOU FIGURE SOMETHING OUT!"" Read above. YOUR SOUL IS NO LONGER YOUR PEOPLE! As much as I loved your company and invested 3 years of my life to it, my last day was the best day of my life. You must find a way to maintain the appointment queue at the genius bar and lessen the stress on the FRS role.

Possible to stick to 9-5 working hours most of the time - productivity is achieved more through discipline than raw time. Candidates beware - most Java development jobs at Apple are actually SRE jobs with 24/7 pager rotation, multiple conference calls on Thanksgiving and Christmas and management taking it for granted that you have to promptly answer phone calls every time of day or night. Now, production monitoring jobs obviously have their place and are necessary in every company. Generally speaking, those should be non-exempt positions that pay overtime and give time off for extra hours. In Apple, it is more like software engineers are expected to work an uncompensated second job with no recognition or benefits.  But most importantly, a company must be as honest and upfront about the nature of each job as a candidate is expected to be about his/her skills. Instead both myself and candidates who were considered after me were actively misled about need to be on-call or spend months manually installing software rather than writing code. This is really a classless act for the worlds richest software company that takes pride in its image and could easily afford to hire extra people to do production support on sane terms.  I should also add that Apple has the most dysfunctional internal transfer process I have seen in my life. I don't blame you if you still want to work on iOS after reading this review, but beware that you will NOT be able to take some other position and then transfer to iOS after building up internal creds. If you work for Apple, but have skills and desire to work on actual Apple products rather than backend, you must quit Apple first. You must sell Apple to your current and future employees the same way you sell it to your customers. Most importantly, this involves honesty, fair work culture and rewarding success by letting people work on more interesting projects (this is far more important than money to talented engineers).

The technology is exciting and the company is very good at hooking you in with the ""Kool-Aid"". Training customers is rewarding and the pay is not at all the best, but it is much better than most full-time retail positions. Management is awful. At the store I was at there was a complete management about a year into my time there, the new management was almost completely new to Apple and had never worked in technology before. People hired and promoted by the old management team were targeted and slowly forced out. We were forced to work with more people than the company asked us to and we were also forced to put up and air of fake happiness to ""keep team morale up"". When someone left they were negatively talked about openly by management and if management felt slighted, you were looked over for promotions. Promotions were almost entirely filled with outside hires, this created a negative atmosphere of broken promises and good people languishing in positions they had mastered. Pay attention to your people. Hire from within and make a clear path of promotion within the store. Morale drops when each new higher position is filled with outside hires. Allow employees to air grievances in a safe environment without fear of retaliation, this was the number one complaint of nearly everyone in our store.",-16.064075,-5.9894214,-0.04932457903338183,0.031745340393903476,3.0,0.17484029484029487,0.4737018837018836

Launching new products were always the best part, because it was always busy, you could work longer shifts, and they were never boring. Overall Apple is a great company to work for. They pay well for a retail job, it's always interesting, and the discounts were great. There are times when hours get cut a lot, but they usually don't last long. I was never an ""Apple fanboy,"" but I did love the products. However, it seems like people get hired more on their enthusiasm for apple products than how well they work. A majority of my co-workers had no work ethic whatsoever and were never reprimanded but promoted. It was a very political environment and less than half the employees were actually competent at their jobs. You do have to deal with many different customers, and often times they would take their frustration out on you. Almost every shift had at least one angry customer you have to deal with, even more if you work as a Creative or Genius. Although you get used to it, it's never fun. Hire and promote employees that are actually good at their jobs. Listen to what your employees have to say.

I was talking to one of them and the intern mentioned visiting Google campus and that it was way more diverse.

The wealth of personal and job growth someone can have working at Apple is unrivaled at any other company. Apple employees, due to excellent training and a stringent selection process are highly skilled and personally well rounded, if not from the moment of hire, they will become that way within the first year of working in the Apple environment. Apple provides a sort of education that can't be learned anywhere else.  Employees are paid well for retail. There are frequent opportunities for lateral movement in the store, and opportunities to ""intern"" or work temporarily at corporate. In a crowded retail environment where employees often get sick from their customers / the public, Apple has an attendance policy that severely punishes employees for taking sick days. Because of this, most employees come to work sick [and sometimes injured], especially during flu season and the holidays, to avoid being penalized. This, in turn, gets more people sick. During the holidays, 30-50% of the employees in the store will be at some degree of ill, many repeatedly re-catching illness from other co-workers.  Upwards mobility is limited. Apple often hires outside manager candidates with little or no experience working in the store and places them in a position to manage people far more experience than them. Apple also has policies in place to prevent managers from building a human connection with the people they manage, such as preventing the few internally hired managers from working with previous co-workers, and preventing managers from having any social interaction with non-management employees outside the store. As a result, managers form their own ""social click"" like the the ""cool kids in high school"" that is entirely detached from the rest of the store. The attendance policy is abusive and bordering on inhumane.

I will have those connections for life. Perks were great, discounts were great, location was great. I was really pleased in how the management was more flexible then I imagined before I was hired on. Everything seemed great at the start, but now you'll want to read the Cons. Where do I begin? Most customers lack basic common sense with electronic gadgets. Then they have the gall to call you a greenhorn and scoff at you because of their ignorance. Highly distasteful attitudes from customers that didn't get their way. I worked in a high end part of town and all the Elites shopped.  I felt that everyone in the Genius Bar area had their head so far up the backside that any new-hire was a complete newcomer and knew absolutely nothing about computers. Very disappointing to work with know-it-alls every day. I will say that there was a nice hazing at first. Instead of the bad hazing, I was treated overly nice for the first three months.  There's a ton of training that is involved when you're first hired on. There's always a push to do it all within a really small amount of time. It's usually always busy in any of the Apple retail stores. When it comes down to the wire, the hustle you like no tomorrow.  Management was somewhat of a disappointment. I have to say that the management is under extreme pressure to do things a certain way, so that is my grain of salt for this situation. Expect them to constantly remind you of ""this"" and ""that."" They seemed to be constantly overwhelmed and would forget about lunch breaks, things of that nature.  I didn't like how some of the management would talk down to you. How everything is so beautiful, wonderful, devine and enchanted. How it's a privilege to work for Apple. Apple has the privilege of hiring on some of the most amazing people I've been around.  Being a realist, it is best to be cut and dry. Being talked down to constantly by people that are typically younger than yourself. Not very enjoyable.  It was difficult to advance in the company because of bad management situations. Set schedules for talks were always canceled and most of the folks that were a tutor/mentor would get out of there as soon as they were done with work. Same for me. Treat the people that have true talent and experience with a little more respect. Help the ones that help everyone else and genuinely want to succeed. Favoritism can be hurtful.

Most of the cons were due to my own personality, but I was continually stressed by times when I would have to try and make meaningful connections with people who didn't understand technology the way I did. I wouldn't trade the experiences I had there for anything, and I met a lot of really amazing and interesting people, but the amount of time I had to spend explaining things to people that seemed second nature to me required a lot of patience to bridge that gap, and that's not for everybody.

It's important to communicate if you don't see eye to eye with an employee, or if you can't necessarily understand their feelings on the subject. I know when you are a manager you worry about rubbing someone the wrong way if you don't completely align with what they are trying to say, but if you don't provide any perspective and just agree with everything, that can almost be just as problematic.

Nobody seemed to know how to answer most of the tech questions, whom they should contact for a given issue, or which internal procedures applied to which situations. It works itself out with time and experience, but the training should be more thorough before people are put on the phones with customers.  There's a steady stream of calls from people who are ticked off and want troubleshooting help, but don't have AppleCare coverage. You have to tell those people, as nicely as possible, to either buy AppleCare for the device, pay $19 for a single issue, or try to find their own answers on the Apple website. Then, when they decline to pay for support and subsequently aren't happy with the outcome, you receive a 'dissatisfied' survey and get to discuss it with your manager. Dumb. Do a better job of educating the public about the fact that their devices don't come with free lifetime tech support.

You can have multiple body piercings, ware unique clothing, hair and shoes (as log as you ware the correct official shirt) but you can't be 7 minutes late. The benefits are very good for retail and available to part time employees. Advancement opportunities are there but a little limited. The pay is OK, probably better than most retail stores. The attitude and atmosphere where I worked was awesome. Many of the plusses are also cons. It is retail sales and that can only be so good. There is a limited to how many irrational, irate customers you can deal with no matter how good you are. Apples strict set of rules can be rigid and unforgiving. When I started there was a ridged corporate rule concerning tardiness. I saw three very good employees be released in two years over legitimate scheduling mistakes that were more the managers fault than the employee. A beloved creative, a hardworking efficient stock person and an excellent full time specialist with excellent sales numbers released because of ridged enforcement of time policy. I understand these rules have now been changed because of the loss of to many good staff.  Apple seemed fixated on hiring managers with a number of years in retail but they don't differentiate by type of retail. WalMart and Kohles don't train you to run an Apple store.  All the best people seem to be transient at an Apple Store, college students working their way through college or professionals who are between jobs. The talented come and go but so many want to work for Apple the supply of staff seems unlimited. I was fortunate enough to do a couple of new store openings. It was a blast but of the stores I saw open in two years 80% of the staff had turned over. In most cases the best and brightest with the best sales and customer satisfaction were gone. I was between professional positions when I worked for Apple Retail. I started as a part time specialist, was promoted to full time, and then expert, and creative. While a specialist I lead the store in sales, sales metrics and customer satisfaction before moving on to another professional position. I love Apple and don't regret my three years in Apple Retail. I would recommend Apple take more care in hiring Managers. Retail experience isn't necessarily a guarantee of success. My experience was that Apple hired managers from low end retail chains that were totally unsuited for an Apple store. Perhaps thinking outside the box on hiring of managers may be a good direction. I fear Apple is aware and actually counts on the transient nature of its retail staff. I can't offer a better alternative but I would like to see Apple Retail become a good carrier choice for some of the excellent transient staff it looses.

45390,apple,2013,"Apple retail offers great health benefits, product discounts, free software, lots of technical and leadership training. The store management empowers the workers to grow themselves professionally and personally. They would rather be helping you to get what you want out of life than getting reamed out by an angry customer. The pay significantly above average for retail employees.  They seem to be listening to the employees and some changes have reflected that.  When they say you can get whatever you want out of your time at Apple it is largely true but takes a lot of work and usually very creative thinking on your part. The #1 con is that most customers lack the skills to use the products. People don't take the time to understand Apple's technology so they blame the store employees when their computers or iPhones don't work. On a daily basis customers don't know their email addresses or passwords and expect you to do a more thorough investigation than Sherlock Holmes in order to help them download an app.  Some co-workers don't try at all or pass their problems around and the result is the good employees clean up the messes.  Performance is not incentive based. The guy who has the highest sales could technically earn as much as the guy with the least amount of sales.  To get a promotion is difficult because there are many people vying for one spot.  Different roles in the store are very stressful. Sometimes we have to help multiple customers at once with very diverse problems. We have to turn people away from tech support because they don't have an appointment to meet with a technician. It gets very difficult after the 20th time in an hour.  Your hours will vary because of the stores longs hours. Sometimes you work early in the morning and sometimes late at night. Usually you will be working on a weekend. Not very fun and not very conducive to family based or social people. Figure out a way for your employees to earn more money.

There are some sociopathic managers at this company who I observed trying to manipulate others just for the pleasure of cruelty. There are some deeply insecure managers holding grudges and trying to get revenge for perceived slights. Honestly, the politics of this place were overwhelming to me. Maybe only 20% of the managers were what I would call ""sick minds"", the rest were honest and sincere, but it was too much for me. I can't play those sorts of games and I had to get out. Sometimes you don't even know that you are playing a game until afterwards.  This is an old company and has a lot of legacy code around. Being innovative often means ignoring glaring problems that have been around for 5 - 10 years. That is kind of painful if you care about quality.

Some managers never got thrown into the lion pit and were able to do well, so if you are considering working there you may get lucky. No one is going to help you out, though.  Definitely better to be an engineer than a manager at Apple, IMO. Keep cleaning house.  Tim Cook recently fired one famous sociopath, who was taking credit for others' achievements and attacking others for perceived slights. I never had to work with him directly, but he is a good proxy for others I'd prefer to not name. But it made me very happy to see that Tim Cook is cleaning house a bit.

45428,apple,2013,"Pays well, great coworkers, good benefits, lots of learning High stress, angry people, very demanding, noisy about the products, as well as myself. I was a Family Room Specialist, which translates roughly to a ""Genius"" of only the mobile devices. I would take appointments all day and try and repair customer's devices (as well as their attitude about it).  My review is for my position only. I can't speak for people of the other positions. But some things carried over consistently for everyone.  PROS: First of all, it pays well for a retail job. All medical benefits are included, even if you're part-time. That's great because you'll be working with A LOT of people and thus tons of germs.  The team is amazing. I have never worked with such a tight-knit group in my life. You can depend on your coworkers for pretty much anything, and they'll be there for you. Apple hires very intelligent, dependable people with great personalities and it shows. You are almost guaranteed to make life-long friends there.  Management is decent and does try to care about your stress level, mental health, and work/life balance as much as possible. They can't take a ton of interest in you considering they have over 100 employees at any one store, but they try very hard to get to know you and talk with you about your goals.  You'll learn a ton about the products. Training is a couple weeks long and you'll never stop learning little bits and pieces. The workers are very smart and you will always learn something from someone during the day.  CONS  The customers. Not all are bad. Most are neutral, but for the most part, you WILL be the brunt of everyone's bad day, bad attitude, or bad personality. You will learn very quickly that customers are complete a**holes who are entitled to everything. There are good ones out there who actually treat you like a human being, but it is very rare. For the most part, you are dealing with people who are already frustrated with their devices and right away you're at a disadvantage with them. You will try your hardest to help them and ease their nerves, but sometimes it gets out of control. I've been sworn at, stormed out on, insulted, and just plain disrespected. I've had customers threaten to shoot themselves in the face because their contacts disappeared. This is no joke. People are very emotional about their phones. It becomes ridiculous. And it gets old REALLY fast. It's draining. You're not a technician, you're a psychologist.  The store is a complete madhouse with noise levels well above normal almost all the time. You will have people at your back consistently and will have to dodge tons of people just to get to the back room. I am claustrophobic and so I did not do well in this environment. The customers even complain that it's ""crazy"" and ""too loud."" You have to raise your voice to even be heard by people standing two feet from you.  There's really no where to go promotion-wise. The stores have only a handful of positions, and none of them are conducive to growth. If you don't want to become a Mac genius or a manager, there's really nowhere to go. It's very dead-end and even those at the top agree with that.  OVERALL  Some people really thrive in that environment and were there for years. I couldn't wait to get out.

Employees who have no business being placed in a leadership roll are often promoted because they are good employees and have to learn how to lead in the store the hard way, sometimes creating difficulty for the teams they are supposed to be leading. If it hasn't been done already, the ""leadership"" and ""team-building"" training that was in place as of May 2011 needs to be done away with and a real leadership training system needs to be implemented. The ""training program"" that was in use at the time was complex, confusing, and made many assumptions about the person going through the training that weren't true for all people.",-3.0732813,4.943395,-0.03212707147419727,-0.017666032237580984,4.0,0.2215277777777778,0.5243055555555557
45459,apple,2013,"- Get to work with bleeding tech - Week off thanksgiving/xmas - Youthful environment, with bright minds - Good RSU package - Poor managers, they view subordinate personal career goals as their attempt to ""climb the corporate ladder"" and its heavily frowned upon at the group I've been in and neighboring groups I've interacted with. - Below average base salary for the bay area. - Poor teamwork, its all about competing against other engineers through a self manufactured obstacle called ""confidentiality"". You only get to see what you are meant to see. Sometimes you want to look at the big picture to help you do your work, too bad. Sometimes you want to interact with key developers to see their design process, too bad. - Projects cancelled left and right. I feel as some are fake projects used to weed out leakers. - Expect to work 50+ hours a week to get anywhere. Apple doesn't see that overworking produces less quality code. They say if you don't spend atleast 50 hours a week you're not being a team player. - Extremely low morale environment - 0 concept of what is good software, some of these people never had to be a software janitor, they fail to see the repercussions of their code and don't write quality code. - Get ready to face high ego developers who still think Apple is the best thing since sliced bread.

45460,apple,2013,"- At least when I first started, the culture was amazing. Creativity was valued and prized. You were taught interesting things, and given projects that tickled your brain if you were interested. - The people were, and still are, some of the most amazing people you'll ever work with. - The managers who are good are absolutely brilliant, amazing, and inspiring. You'll want to jump off a cliff for them. - The onsite benefits are pretty rocking. Cafeteria, very nice gym, lovely campus, onsite Toastmasters group (at least while I was there), various employee organizations and clubs, etc. - There's a lot of growth, so if you can play the politics game, you have a bright future ahead of you As I continued on in my career at Apple, the company grew up and became more corporate. What does that mean? Fewer people got promoted from within (preferring instead to get people form the outside, people with MBAs, etc.) - As good as the benefits are, there were some serious lacks (example: No paternity leave, no paid leave for adoption, no sabbaticals, etc.) - Very few managers (and certainly almost no upper managers) care about the customer. They care about the number, but not about the actual customer. - The pay is okay at best. They brag that they're solidly average. This seems counterintuitive for one of the richest companies in the world. Value your human capital. - You do have to play politics. Which often translates to keeping your mouth shut. Anger the wrong person and you may as well quit because your career there is over. - A lot of the skills they teach aren't transferrable. Instead of certifying people in recognized brands (PMP, ASTD, etc.), they prefer to do their own certifications in house, which don't mean anything anywhere else. There's a certain amount of brainwashing that you start to believe as an Apple employee. Namely, that because you work at Apple, there is no other company anywhere that is possibly even a tenth as awesome and hip and reliable as Apple - if you ever have the audacity to leave, every job for the rest of your career will be worse. It isn't true, but this attitude prevents Apple from caring as much about their employees as they could (and should). True, the benefits are great, but the culture definitely suffered in the time I was there. A few things I would look at:  - Rethink how you want the culture to be. Do you want people to have the freedom and creativity to make things better for coworkers and the customer, or do you want them to say ""Yes Sir"" to the Powers that Be, sit down, and be quiet? - Invest in employees, both in terms of their professional and personal development - Take a hard look at the managers that you hear are terrible. If a manager has a reputation for being awful, you should probably work on managing them out, not just proving them around to different teams. This isn't the Catholic church. - If you see a drastic change in peoples' behavior, try asking them what's wrong, rather than assuming that they've suddenly become bad employees. - Value your top performers. Keep them challenged. The fastest way to make a top performer your worst performer is to let them get bored.",2.6412709,-8.155333,-0.0015625517743502258,0.05698248958488327,3.0,0.09854639804639807,0.5558217338217338

So you have a bigger chance to get noticed for your work. The only problem is, everybody is a rock star. - Good opportunities to take job related training - my manager always encourages me to take as many related courses as I want. The difficult part is taking the time out to do this. - Fair performance review process + cash bonus + RSUs. - People who've done their time at Apple (read: Older employees) seem more laid back compared to the more recent hires/younger blood. This causes bottlenecks in projects which are extremely fast moving and need juggling of multiple priorities at the same time - NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. I regularly work 50-60 hours per week. The sad thing is, the more you work, the more people expect from you and the more you work. If you treat it just like a job, you might stick around, but you'll be passed on when the good projects come in. You need to decide what type of career you want - you can't do 40 hours AND shine at work at the same time. - High burnout rate. I find myself short of patience many times just because there's always too much to do. - Base salary is not that good, but more than compensated for in the form of cash bonus, RSUs, 401k - Don't let us burn out.

If you work in IS&T and you love project management, then this is for you. Every IS&T department team is governed by the onshore and offshore vendor model primarily from India companies. If you enter as a developer, you will be involuntarily assigned to work as a technical program/project manager role where you will delegate all your code to onshore and offshore developers. Sometimes you'll get good developers, but most of the time, you'll get mediocre or below-average developers. There is no diversity in this department as the overall ethnicity is 99.999% India descent. Most of the senior managers are not technical, not hands-on and rely solely on the program/project managers/consultants to deliver all projects for them. The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers. The performance reviews can be conducted arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager. It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit. Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night. The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk. There is a lot of politics and arrogance. One director hired most of her managers from her previous company. Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association. So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism? If you don't belong in that ""3com club"", then you will not be as richly compensated. e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.  Just to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department. All other product development teams - iCloud, iTunes, etc. will not have this environment. Furthermore, it can be confirmed that those departments are more diverse in ethnicities, rely on badged employees for development work, and work long hours depending on the team and project. Change needs to take place from the CEO down if IS&T was to become a better work place. Move out of the onshore/offshore India vendor model and reorganize all management. Hire diverse, computer science-degreed, technical managers and permanent employees who understand technologies and can be hands-on.

They will up-sell EVERYTHING to customers, despite being the most valuable brand in the world. This was central to me ending my career with Apple. You do a great job at motivating your people but the targets are relentless and definitely not the spirit of the Apple of old. Maybe I'm naive in thinking that spirit died with Steve Jobs, but there was a noticeable shift in attitudes coinciding with that.

This company siphons talent, time and energy dry.

Most people are better ending somewhere else and that's why they do. Plus the customer traffic is HUGE so the workload goes accordingly. -Career opportunities are close to none. You can get a promotion when someone is leaving and yes, a lot of people are leaving every year but this bear questioning why? -They work with headcounts so once the limit is met, even if the need for more employees is there, even if the metrics proves its there, they will not hire more or give any promotion. -Not enough staff. The workload is incredibly huge and at first you are motivated to give the best of services but you understand fast enough that they ask for the impossible. They could hire twice the number of employees and still it would be complicated so imagine how hard it is now. -Work/Life balance is bad. Part time employees will work mostly 4h shifts right in the middle of the day so it completely destroys their schedule, and full time employees will often work 8-9 days in a row including night and weekends and with only one day off in between (they have to organize with others to have 2 days off in a row). Stop being hypocritical by saying things like : ""Our employees are the most important thing for us"". If it was true, the cons I mentioned would not exist. Stop being cheap and invest a little more in your employees and their work conditions. You could invest only 1% of the profits and it would make a huge difference (better/bigger break rooms, more lockers, better/bigger bathrooms, some bonuses for motivation, etc). That's what makes it so hard on the employees. You could easily care more but you just don't. And for the love of God, PLEASE HIRE MORE PEOPLE !!!

If you can't hit your targets, management will give you a hard time and in some cases try to push you out.  - Management take the customer service culture very literally. For example, some will almost always side with the customer and not with you as an employee, leading many to feel undervalued and disrespected. Often you have to go with policy and give the customer a hard line, and when they ask to see a manager, they'll do almost whatever the customer wants and make you look like the bad guy. Probably common in retail, but seriously demotivating.  - The whole process of career advancement and development is very opaque and shrouded in mystery. If managers like you and you have good numbers, they'll give you opportunities – if not, you'll have to fight very hard to even hear about them in the first place and even more so to be considered. At my store the vast, vast majority of people never advance or get promoted, and many are trying very hard to.  - Customers at times can be brutal. At Apple you're the front face, up against people who have crazy expectations of what Apple can do for them.

I've been pushed, screamed and sworn at. Don't underestimate this one.  - When it gets busy, it really gets busy. It really tests your ability to deal with pressure and stress to the extreme when customers are pulling you in five different directions and managers are telling you do 'one to many' sales and support. Most of my managers became stressed out at these times, hyper-intense and irritable – and because they're so focused on making customers happy, they invariably take it out on the employees.

Its a brand thats easy to be passionate about, the product quality is second to none and its not really like any other retail business. I think the biggest win for Apple Retail is the culture, it stands apart from Apple Inc because of a very specific people-focused credo and entrenched standards. Do not be fooled into thinking this is a way into Apple Inc. A lot of people think that by joining as a Specialist they'll somehow be designing the latest products within 5 years.  Everything is controlled from the US, this can lead to a less flexible understanding of the EU and its laws/practices that can cause problems as the company doesn't acknowledge the differences.  Can take longer to progress but this is because its an environment full of talented people. Understand that you're running a global business, not just a US one.  Learn what made Apple Retail different, now that Steve and Ron have gone, the culture is harder to maintain and all of the monetary decisions from Tim are more in line with traditional retail business.

This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.

This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range. The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead.

Tons of opportunities supporting all the different business groups, functional orgs such as Marketing, Retail, Entertainment, Devices and Services orgs as well as various areas around the world. Employees in Finance can pursue great opportunities to support any mix of these organizations and areas. Some managers allow flexibility to simply do a great job and reward employees based on performance which means you can decide which meetings to prioritize, work from home, etc. Just do a great job, provide status updates in weekly or bi-weekly 1:1 meetings and/or team meetings and you are rewarded based on feedback from business partners, lots of opportunities for awards and other recognition.

Like with most jobs your happiness will partly depend on your manager, your team and your business partners. If you are considering interviewing make sure to ask plenty of questions to make sure your goals are aligned with the manager and team. Unfortunately, the turnover is quite high at Microsoft due to people moving into new roles every 2-3 years which is encouraged. This means you may take a job and have a new manager in 6 months and the new manager may or may not have the management style you work well with, but you only have to wait a year to move to another role.

Most are hands off which means you need to learn your job and do your job without backup. You own your career at Microsoft which can be a pro or con depending on what you want. Just know that you need to focus on doing your best and push for yourself. Managers are supportive but don't proactively help out - it's on you to make your career what you want.

The culture fosters distrust among colleagues. For example, even if the manager is not present in a meeting, words gets to the manager somehow even after you made a comment and caveated it by saying that this discussion is strictly inside the meeting room only.  The management tries to manage by keeping informational silos with the employees and acts arbitrarily to do what is advantageous to them. For example, I have been in groups where promotions were never shared and kept a secret. If management wants to give you a good rating, they will share the feedback you have got from your business partners.If the management wants to give you a bad rating, then they will say that the policy is not to share the feedback.  The company will try to hire you down if you are coming from other company. The overall compensation is not good compared to many other companies, especially since they hire you in a lower position.

58204,microsoft,2013,"1. Pay and benefits are great. Not excellent, but great.  2. If you don't have great ambitions, you can maintain a good work-life balance. Once you get to the ""Senior"" level in the career ladder, it's easy to just relax and get lost among the cracks. Management is going to assume that you ""plateaued"", and let you stay where you are.  3. Company pays a lot of importance to ethics and being a good world citizen. Pays generously to charities and has a great charity donation matching program. 1. The company is too big and too slow. I don't know what exactly the reason for this is, but everything in the company just seems to happen so slowly, even down to minor everyday tasks such as getting a single bug fixed.  2. People in the company are nowhere near as smart as some people think, particularly the new hires. In a market where companies like Google, Facebook, etc. are soaking up the cream of the crop, Microsoft has certainly lowered their standards and is settling for those who cannot make it into such companies. The really smart people are those that have been around for a decade or so, from back when Microsoft could attract those kind of people. The rest are probably still better than your average code-monkey, but nowhere near as good as they need to be to turn this company around. On rare occasions you come across some surprisingly incompetent people.  3. Performance system is broken:  - Rewards are tied to how much visibility the work you do has, i.e., the more the number of people who know what you are doing, the better your chances of a favorable performance rating. This may seem justified on paper, because the higher the ""visibility"" of your work, the more important it is. However, what ends up happening is that it basically becomes a popularity contest. You may be working on something that might be the most important thing for your immediate team, but since no one outside your team knows that, it is very unlikely you will be rewarded for your work. The ""new"" review system that was announced recently doesn't change any of this.  - No matter what they tell you, there is definitely a minimum time period you need to be in each level before you get promoted to the next, no matter how good you are.  - It's all about being in the right place at the right time. Good opportunities are hard to come by, and they keep moving around the company. Currently it looks like all the good opportunities are in the Windows Phone group. People there are getting promoted like crazy. Whereas in Windows, there is a huge dearth of good opportunities. And since the average seniority of employees in Windows in much higher, the few good opportunities go to the senior folks, leaving the junior folks with very little, making it hard to progress up the career ladder.  4. Lack of good vision from leadership: Given the mess we are in right now, we need a Steve Jobs to turn us around.  5. Ancient engineering practices: When I left school, I was eager to get into some actual software engineering and learn cool things like TDD, unit-testing, UML, etc. I am saddened to say that my co-workers and I are still writing code like it is for a class project. I think Microsoft relies more on a strategy wherein junior developers are just not given much important and complicated work until after they have gained a few years of experience. That's no way to do software engineering in today's world. While SDETs churn out huge, complicated, and heavy test frameworks for testing products, the reality is that these tests usually never catch any bugs, and most bugs are found in production.  6. You better be prepared to spend the rest of your life working with Microsoft technologies: They avoid OSS and non-Microsoft solutions like the plague, which, to be fair, might be justified because of the potential for legal troubles. But if you are coming to work here, be prepared to say goodbye to the rest of the technology world.

They have training classes on everything you could think of, and for those who manage to get themselves into the good graces of management who likes them, the sky is the limit. There are still good jobs at Microsoft, but it's hard to find them. There is a strong tradition of failing upwards. The company has lost a lot of its best and brightest to other companies, and the bottom-feeders that are left tend to be very bad at their jobs. The company's biggest problem is how political it is. You will never get a promotion on the merits of the job you do, you must get into the ""inner circle"" of a higher-up manager to have any chance. Most of the time, instead of dealing with the politics, people just get fed up and leave -- and forever after have nightmares about their experience.  The company has a mandate to fire 7% of their employees a year, and if you aren't in the top-tier inner circle, you feel like you're always fighting for your job. Every promotion you get is one that someone else did not.  Avoid the Office division like the plague, it is the least innovative part of the company. The technical stagnation of ""It's been done this way for years, and we'll continue to do it this way"" permeates every part of the product. You will not grow or learn there. For some, it's OK because they have a relatively high paying job that doesn't expect much of them. But I wanted more. Get rid of HiPo, The Bench, 1+, or if you decide to keep them, tell employees they exist and who is and is not on them, and what the criteria for them is. Listen to your employees, and focus on making good managers versus managers who are good at managing up.

Microsoft is a cutthroat organization, where employees are pitted against each other due to the forced ""normal curve"" whereby managers are forced to grade employees on a graded list, with the bottom 10% judged to be ""C"" players that need to be weeded out. HR still forces you to grade on this curve, regardless of how small or large your team is, and how well the team has performed. It creates a very bad environment where people often don't want to help each other out on projects.  Also, another downside is that because MSFT is so huge, they tend to be very internally focused and don't spend enough time looking at interesting things happening in the industry outside of Redmond.

You learn things, for better or worse, and grow in your career.  If you are in a department with good morale and product you can have lots of fun in your work and get to know many great people. Its a very passive aggressive workplace. Not many people will tell you to your face if they have issues with you. They will go to your manager or coworkers though. It makes you feel as if you have to watch yourself at all times as you never know what someone is saying behind your back. Depending on the department you may or may not get much work life balance. Some departments are great but others are horrible. The horrible ones may know it and really don't care. You either work the massive hours or leave.  The review system is horrible. You have a great bunch of smart motivated employees who are all striving to do their best. However the review system forces someone to get a negative review. If you get a negative review you have zero options. You cannot move anywhere in the company, you are not even allowed to interview, and get zero monetary compensation for your work. Employees are so worried about getting a poor review that they compete in a negative way against each other. Other employees are seen as threats to their review scores. Its almost impossible to truly collaborate when you are worried helping your co-workers will negatively impact your performance review.  The managers will tell you 'its only an evaluation for 1 year's worth of work'. However its almost impossible to recover from a negative review. You can try your hardest but the management will say 'we're giving opportunities to others with better reviews'. At the end of the next year you'll be in the same place, not for lack of trying, but for lack of support from management and not getting additional opportunities to succeed. You'll end up leaving or being asked to leave because of supposed 'poor performance'. But the review system forced someone to be at the bottom even if everyone on the team did well. Its a very crazy system. Many of the legacy top management consider leaving, or get some intense training on how to do things differently. Any management that supports the kind of review system that will not allow employees to truly collaborate is in my opinion not the best senior leadership.  Microsoft has been behind in many recent technology innovations (smart phones, tablets, etc) and some of their current technologies have lost significant market share (Internet Explorer, Hotmail, Office, etc). The Millennial generation uses Google and Apple. You'll find college students now that have never used a Microsoft product in their lives. If the company wants to remain relevant it has to change.  Could it be that employees are so worried about their performance reviews they won't take risks anymore? They are so afraid of failure and negative reviews that great ideas get pushed aside to make sure they are making their current goals.

Microsoft's persistent use and defense of this outdated, intelligence-insulting and ineffective performance evaluation tool continues to fragment and drive away people who are most intellectually prepared to rescue the company. It is not the same model that's being used at other corporations, it is being abandoned at a restless clip at least partially because of Microsoft's very public example of how it fails. The many levels at which stack-ranking has eviscerated Microsoft's culture, environment, product line and innovation are staggering. Prospective candidates for Microsoft employment should really investigate as to whether Google, Apple or some other well-funded tech start-up has opportunities for them until stack-ranking is abolished and new leadership resets their company's priorities.  - A ""chase-after"" mentality, rather than an inventive one. They've fallen behind the rest of the game, and for obvious reasons that doesn't bode well.  - The inferiority complex tends to permeate all sectors of the company. It's the tech world's Charlie Brown.  - The isolationist culture in Redmond takes away any chance of long-range or visionary goals. It will take a full transfusion which Ballmer and Gates have stymied over the past decade. Stack-ranking has to be publicly stopped with no ambivalence. Limits on innovation and outward views, even if they're unspoken, need to be blown apart. In-fighting and political machinations need to be, not just gotten rid of, but punished by management when they occur.

Reasonable pay. Good stock award plan. Good benefits. Lots of career potential. Highly political and lots of people spending most of their time looking good instead of actually getting work done. The infamous rating system really drives the wrong behaviour. Innovation is very slow, which too often puts us on the back foot when trying to compete. Realistic, pragmatic and constructive criticism of our company is not appreciated. We are all just supposed to be positive about everything all the time and not raise any suggestions for improvement. Hard to change processes even if it makes infinite sense. 1) Simplify the rating system to three ratings. We all know who the 1s are and we typically also know who the 5s are. Consolidate the 2, 3 and 4 ratings. The actual performance difference between a 2 and a 4 is tiny, but the impact from a compensation and future job potential perspective is huge. The rating system should also take ""team work"" into account. 2) Institute a culture where ""constructive challengers"" are rewarded. Today it is much easier to advance by being a ""yes-man"" than to constructively challenge the status quo. 3) Be more customer/partner centric... that is an obvious one. 4) Stop believing our own BS. A good example is Surface. Nice product, not great product. We price it similarly to iPad and only make it available in our own stores. 8 months later we take a $900M charge. Imagine if the Windows BG had listened to some of the field feedback and priced the Surface aggressively (lets say a $900M investment) and made it broadly available. We would have been in a much stronger market position today, but our LT decided to protect our old cash-cow (Windows) instead of going for market share (future).",-2.957186,0.98003614,-0.0283276836820003,0.017221231233169924,4.0,0.15584776334776335,0.511677489177489

58448,microsoft,2013,"I worked as an FTE here for five years. People are smart, it's a fun environment, salaries are good, and there's a lot of variety in the work. Health benefits used to be great, but now they're pretty much on par with other companies. I left the company for the reasons stated below, but now I work at Microsoft as a vendor. There's a ton of work available for vendors/contractors at Microsoft! Most teams want to hire contractors with prior Microsoft experience, so if you're a former FTE, you've got it made. If you accept a vendor position with one team and hate it, you can end your contract and just search for a new contract on another team. And the best part is, as a vendor/contractor, you don't have to deal with the horrible performance review system! And you don't have to deal with stupid ""visibility"" projects. You can just do your work and get paid for it and not have to deal with the internal politics. It's a sweet deal! You'll notice that more and more of the contractors/vendors at Microsoft are former FTEs, and now you know why. Company has gone downhill since I first started working there. The biggest problem is the performance review system. They've revamped it several times, but they still use a stack-ranking system and award scores based on a curve. This is horribly demoralizing! To make matters worse, your manager can award you a certain score, but managers above him or her can lower your score in order to get their org to fit the curve. So if your manager gives you a 2, for example, a higher-up manager can lower it to a 3 because the org already has too many 2's. How screwed up is that?! I finally left when this happened to me. I worked my butt off, got a great review, but then the GM bumped my score down because I wasn't ""visible"" enough. The guy didn't even know me! God forbid he actually listen to my manager (who knows my work) and read my review! How are we supposed to stay motivated knowing that at review time some random manager can change our score at will? Over the years I found that employees in general are more concerned with trying to make themselves visible to management so they'll get a good review, than they are with trying to put out a good product for our customers. The focus is all me, me, me, when the focus should instead be on our customers.  I worked as both an individual contributor and as a manager during my time here. I found that Microsoft doesn't value good people-management skills. They want their managers to be PMs. They want managers who will keep projects on track and lead a multitude of special projects. The actual people-management part of it takes a backseat. I loved being a manager outside of Microsoft, but being a manager inside of Microsoft is a thankless job. You don't get paid any more for managing, and it's twice the stress. That's why so many managers decide to go back to being an individual contributor.  The other big problem is that people switch teams all the time. Teams are constantly losing their knowledge base. It's really bad when PMs leave, and then new PMs come onboard and have to ramp up, or they decide they want to redesign how something is done in the middle of a project. Oh, and re-orgs happen ALL the time! That screws up everything, including project schedules. No one knows who's responsible for what, and all the worker bees twiddle their thumbs waiting for management to figure out what the heck is going on. Get rid of the stack-ranking, curve-based performance review system. It's counterproductive. You're losing a lot of talented people because of it. Focus on putting out quality products that work, instead of just trying to get to market quickly and worrying about dealing with bugs later. Don't overlook the value of good user documentation! Your products/services aren't intuitive, even though you may think they are.

In some cases these ""bad managers"" are really just terrible at what they do - more often it is a politics problem.  The politics are horrifying.

58560,microsoft,2013,"I love it here. I have been at the company for 9 years and I think it is a great place to work. I am a single income earner, I support a family of 4 comfortably, I have good (not great) work/life balance, I feel valued in my job, I support my leadership's broader ambitions, even if I disagree tactically from time to time.  Slackers are not welcome. Microsoft pays for performance. How do I know? Because I am one of those calibrating people. I see the review model from the inside, I am one of those applying the 1-5 model to people. It is widely misunderstood, has great merit and accomplishes its purpose (however bluntly.)  We differentiate, and reward high performers. The primary function of the 1-5 stack rank is to distinguish who did ""better"" - contrary to popular perception that it is a way to indicate who isn't cutting it. Most people at the company do a fine job, but like every other workplace, certain individual stand out. The are rewarded accordingly. I'll challenge any existing employee at the company who believes that this stack rank is anything other than merit-based to go and find a new role. There are a lot of people at the company getting it right when it comes to evaluating people.  In case you needed evidence to the fact, consider how many layoffs have occurred in the past 5 years, despite our ongoing stack/rank practices. If the company truly believed its 4's and 5's were underperforming, they wouldn't be here.  This company gives over $100M to charity every year. People are very passionate and dedicated to the things they value most, and the company rewards that passion with matching for time and money. Despite my approval of the general concept of differentiation, I do find the 1-5 stack rank process to be a little stark, and hard for people to appreciate. The real problem is that if you get a lower rating, you get a lower bonus and stock award. The way to resolve that problem is to reward the high performers less and the low performers more. On the surface 99% of employees are simply unwilling to do that, because they believe they are a 1 or 2, and everybody else are the 4's and 5's.  This is a large company, and your success is largely dependent on relationships and your ability to connect with your peers. This is counter-intuitive to many. The best technology doesn't always win, but the most compelling argument does. Building those takes trust, consistent results and a good network. I suspect some times we're leaving great ideas on the cutting room floor for sake of relationships across the company. While it is great to have a collaborative culture, the degree to which feedback loops become galvanized and impenetrable is far too great. We need more disruption from the ground. There is a tremendous amount of talent within this company. Give people a break. We do great work here. We're making more money than we can count. The company's products are so large as to lack a market segment... ""the world"" is the way we measure things. Flogging employees over attainment of micro-accountabilities has value, but the degree to which the 1-5 model punishes people for doing what they are asked to do is painful and hard to sell as a leader of people.",-11.078592,5.3849635,-0.035143812599129444,0.007149705274180821,4.0,0.17992282307856083,0.5696529699808389

It is in your best interest to get hired in at highest stock level possible. In practice, stock level will dictate your base salary and stock awards while review score (1 thru 5 with 1 the highest) dictates bonus and usually promo. The review system of ""stack rank"" promotes disunity, dysfunction and discord. It is a cancer. Think hunger games. By the way I get 1's consistently and I still feel awful for the others that worked harder (but not smarter) than me. Your direct ""lead"" is useless, with no management training or accountability your lead feels lie a peer instead of a mentor. You must actively seek out mentors on your own. Career advancement is slow and not always in your control. You could have a great year and get a 1 but be told that you haven't been in your current level long enough. So, go kick butt for another year and hope for Pomo next time. 2 years in your level is considered pretty good. Again, make sure you start as high as possible, it takes a while to climb that ladder!

The company has also invested in making managers and leaders better, and is very generous when it comes to benefits, stock, bonuses with also competitive base pay. Depending on the role you're in, bonuses can go up significantly, especially in sales roles which are highly leveraged. The more senior levels get significantly more stock based on their reviews. Stock is granted each year based on performance and is doled out over a 5 year vesting period (20% each year). That means that after being in the senior ranks for a few years, significant amounts of stock can be had by high performers. There's no doubt about it, Microsoft is a competitive place, and intentionally so. If you think you'll stay above the office politics and aren't savvy enough to know how to play the game you run a real risk of being trampled. Unlike some disgruntled folks, I think for the most part the system works, all sizzle and no steak types don't last - but the highest performers tend to be highly effective at what they do, effective collaborators and yes, successful at self promotion.

The gaming of the system is embarrassing to witness, for a company that professes to be something else, and perhaps was at one point. The middle-management problem stifles a great deal of possible innovation.  IMO, senior management is completely out of touch with what it is like to try to build your career at the mid-stages at this company. Most of them did that in the 90's --- a very, very different time. It appears that they believe the same set of motivations are still in place for people, even though the compensation through company growth (stock, etc.) is not even remotely the same. As the Vanity Fair article pointed out, the only way to grow in compensation at Microsoft these days is to become a manager (or a very hot-shot engineer) --- thus the hyper-competition and gamesmanship.  All that said, if you can kind of settle in and allow for the fact that career development is going to be 20% you and about 80% random factors beyond your control (unless you are truly a master politician and brown-noser), then there's some cool work to be done and decent people to work around. Get in touch with the fact that it isn't the 1990's, and drop the forced underperformer dynamic from your performance management system. Develop REAL programs for people who want to contribute more by being great managers, and accept that there is a real thing called management that doesn't require you to be an engineer.

You will get the chance to create something that your friends and family will actually directly use. First, your co-worker is officially your enemy. Expect to be stabbed in the back. Some will say they will help you and tell everyone else how much they are helping you, but then will actually do barely any actual work to deliberately undermine you. Other people will talk badly about you. Others will take credit for your work, possibly your own manager. Most people are good honest folks, but watch out for the bad ones. Especially be watchful for managers who were forced to get themselves promoted out of whatever it was they originally did very well. This is well beyond the normal level of office politics. Your first years will seem great but problems compound over time.  This is a result 3 things: 1. The performance review system is a forced curve. 10% of all employees will be graded at the bottom rung and put on ""probation"" or ""corrective measures"". Thus, if you do well but are on a team of 10 great employees, you will be in the bottom 10%. 2. You must move up the corporate ladder (""you are expected to grow""). Otherwise, you will be forced out of the company. Even if you are incredible at what you do and love it, you must move up (ex: great SDETs must become managers, sometimes lousy managers). 3. Promotion velocity: if you don't move up the corporate ladder fast enough, you will soon become unpromotable regardless of how well you perform.  Second, technical ability is not valued as much as management ability. If you love to code, expect to find less and less time to code as you do more management of either other full-time employees and/or contractors and/or vendors. Contractors and vendors do much of the technical work these days. They need to fix the review system so that teams function as teams.

A lot of potential if execs can sort themselves out. Managers in most cases treat employees like dirt and as completely expendable. They're fast becoming an Oracle sales mentality. One person at a very high level has completely changed the atmosphere, and the way the stack ranking now runs is worse than the Vanity Fair article described. It's a dog eat dog environment, where how good you are, and how much you contribute has little to nothing to do with your chances of success, and how much you suck up to managers in your district, or how much ""visibility"" you have is the only measure of success. The fact that the hiring manager for the last job I had there over 9 years told me first and foremost 'lets figure out how to get you enough visibility so that I can defend you in the stack ranking' instead of discussing what I should be doing in my job says it all. This appears to be pretty much endemic at MS now, and every week I hear of yet another awesome employee leaving or being forced out. However, the Mid-Atlantic States District is particularly bad, with politics that I have never seen in my 20 years in IT and sales. MS also treats partners terribly. Partner CSAT scores are gamed. The level of frustration in the partner community has never been higher. Partners depend on MS for a lot of revenue, but most hate MS because of the way they are treated. Firstly, stop changing MS to Walmart.. Ever since a particular exec come on board, this company has lost so many of its best employees, that it's impossible to keep track any more. He openly told us in one of our first Town Hall meetings with him that our attrition rate was unhealthily low, and he intends to change that. He's certainly succeeded in doing that amazingly well.  Secondly, do away with the stack ranking. Stop thinking only tactically. In sales, its all about what you've done for me today, and people with an exemplary track record for 9 or 10 years get fired for 1 bad year that was likely bad because of relatively randomly set quotas, circumstances beyond their control (like companies going bankrupt), or sales managers finding scapegoats.  You tell everyone that customer deployment and CSAT are important metrics in CBI, yet people get $0 CBI unless they hit the ever more difficult 100% quota/RBI metric, and then you're surprised when people only start to focus on CBI once they're hit their quota late in Q4?. What do you think people will focus on? This isn't a healthy 'tension' as someone very senior once told me. Its a recipe for disaster.  Bring back the company that used to be the best place to work for in the world. In my 1st 4 years at MS, I fully intended to make it a life long career, moving around, learning and contributing more every year. Now I wouldn't come back if you paid me $1m a year. It's not worth it. And finally, get HR people who employees can really trust.

58989,microsoft,2013,"It has amazing benefits. It has gone down starting 2013 because healthcare is no longer 100% supported, and that's a huge step down, but other than that it has amazing benefits. You work in a rich company, you often get offices, you can easily get very good quality multiple monitors and desktops, you keep getting other freebies.  People there are very smart, you can learn a lot. Also, since we are working within Microsoft, most of Microsoft's latest technologies is readily and freely available to its employees to use in their teams. Most teams constantly try to keep up to date with the latest technologies and releases, so you are able to work on cutting edge technologies more easily than in smaller companies that can't afford to keep upgrading their Microsoft products every 2 years. The biggest con for me is the stack ranking. There are 5 levels - 1 to 5, 1 being the best and 5 being the worst. Every team will have at least a few people getting a 1. This puts a continuous pressure throughout the year to compete with your immediate peers. Competition is always there in all companies, sure, but with stack ranking it is much more so because if you don't do better than your immediate collegues you will get a low rank. This discourages team work.  The other con is the fact that the review process is very harsh on people who have ever performed poorly. If you have gotten bad reviews in earlier years, it will affect your review this year. To me that doesn't make sense. If you did well this year, you should get rewarded for it. In 2012 they finally changed a system which affected all senior people in the company, because they used to take into consideration your potential for promotion, and senior level employees don't necessarily have that kind of opportunity for promotion. Now they don't take the future into account, but they take into account previous years.  The third issue is that if you remain at a level for too long, it affects your review as well. It is similar to the previous point, except that this is specifically about staying at a level, not just the review scores. You don't get a good review, or you don't get a promotion too easily, because you did not move up the promo ladder fast enough. This means that you can't stay in the company and do your job and be fine with it, you have to constantly try for a promotion, you have to constantly compete with your friends.  Of course, you have to work hard, and no matter how hard you work, you always feel guilty that you didn't do enough. You're always on, never fully relaxed. Maybe that's just me.  The last, painful point is that your entire review/promo life depends on your manager. If the manager has something against you, you are stuck, even if you are a good employee. The manager holds the power to tell you what the good projects are that you should work on, where people are looking ahead to. Other managers won't tell you because they want their directs to do well. This cut throat competition makes it hard for someone who landed a manager he can't work with. Once you join a team you can't typically switch to another team before a year, and the manager has the right to keep you for one and a half years. So it ends up being slow. Fix the review system so teamwork is possible! And instead of just talking about work-life balance, make it so people can actually relax in the evenings and weekends!",-4.1604443,-7.860772,-0.015508442749837894,0.04978160558911336,4.0,0.0822352685366384,0.5549510763209393

Unfortunately this healthy heterogeneity is disappearing, and the trend is movement in the wrong direction. Those groups that treat people with respect as individuals and team players versus commodities, that insist on transparency top, down and sideways, and that have strong, collaborative leadership founded on integrity - they are increasingly harder to find. For those groups that lack these characteristics, the annual performance review model is organizationally poisonous, damaging team cohesion, productivity, and employee morale. Team members are distracted from collaboratively delivering business value by necessary attention to political visibility. Problems and delivered solutions may be artificially inflated or worse, manufactured in the interest of management support at review time. Performance management, employee recognition and rewards are all critical management accountabilities in any organization. However, these accountabilities are not best assured by forcing managers to fit their staff review results to a static distribution curve regardless of overall team talent. Careers can end quickly despite an employee's current and long term positive performance track record. If the manager relationship sours, or the employee expresses interest in moving elsewhere in the company, managers will often leverage that employee to fill the poor performance quota. As risk tolerance falls, bureaucracy grows. The increasing administrative burden is further degrading conditions necessary to team agility, efficiency and innovation. Proactively validate, recognize and resolve risks to the future of the company. Find the courage to identify and eliminate behaviors founded on self-serving preservation, and reward those based on integrity. Start with management at all levels. Extend the performance review model to reward not only individual but team, group, and company. Proof the review model against managers without integrity. Leverage the value in increasingly frequent exit interviews to reduce their frequency in the future. Reduce the corporate risk target with spin offs for multiple lines of business.

66109,microsoft,2013,"There is a tremendous buzz at Microsoft, all of the people are smart and driven to succeed. If Microsoft aren't first in pretty much anything the question is always ""what do we need to do to be number 1?"".  This behaviour is endemic and really underpins the culture of the entire organisation.  I worked in the consulting organisation (MCS) and experienced a real variety of projects across a number of customer organisations. Delivering projects when you knew that your team were real experts and that they had the backup of the product development team was incredibly reassuring and this allowed MCS to bid for projects that other technology delivery organisations would shy away from.  Getting in to MCS is not easy, the bar is very high and the interview process lengthy. Expect a telephone interview which, if successful, would be followed by an all day interview which would consist of 3 interviews (peer/competency, hiring manager and HR) plus a role play/programming exercise.  Microsoft has a great benefits package including free broadband and mobile 'phone. One the things that I particularly liked was the free bowl of fruit in the kitchen every day. The challenge with working at Microsoft is the challenge with being visible ALL OF THE TIME. Unless your manager and their immediate peers are intimately aware of your achievements then you will be punished during the review process. The drawbacks of this process are well documented within glassdoor but any system that holds the employee review meeting AFTER the grade has been decided is, in my view, seriously flawed.  If you are unlucky enough to be on a long-term project that can seriously impact you, and if that project is on customer site then you can really be in trouble. Also, if you are not valued by your manager then you can get you in trouble as well!!!!  There is also a blame culture emerging in MCS which, if isn't eradicated, will make it not a nice place to work.  With regard to salary, MCS is OK, you don't work there for the money, you work there to get an exposure to the culture and the experience. Microsoft make it very easy for you to work from anywhere at any time and there is a growing expectation that that is exactly what you do. Some managers send email out of hours and then complain when you haven't responded in what they consider a timely manner. Change the review system such that it is based on what the staff deliver and not on management's perception of what they have done.",-11.869653,-2.0286295,-0.05069881820868331,0.02950673746939047,3.0,0.18082810099846394,0.5960706605222734
