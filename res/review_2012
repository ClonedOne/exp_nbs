This can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org. Often, those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in Engineering/Product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest (sure, that acquisition looks fabulous and it's only $100M! I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense. This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong.  Finance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience. This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don't understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriously - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we're moving to a monthly forecast view instead). At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang.  Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don't seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful. Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere.  Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions. Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources. Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be ""scrappy"" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data. Upside is that without a data source no one's likely to know if you're completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions.  There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don't support the Search / Ads business. Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve.

7433,google,2012,"Google has a lot of perks, financial incentives, and other benefits that make being a Googler enjoyable. If/when I leave, I'll definitely miss the ways that my life is easier because of them.  One of the things I enjoy most is listening to the founders (Larry Page and Sergey Brin) talk at large meetings (especially David Drummond, when he shares news). They're both funny and intelligent, and I think their reputations as visionaries are probably mostly accurate. My experience here is limited, but most of the people I know who started around the same time as me have identical complaints: Google doesn't want thinkers for the majority of their engineers, they want short-order cooks and yes-men. In all my career, the only place I've worked that was even comparable to Google was Wells Fargo (which was a ridiculously unfulfilling place to work as an engineer).  Additionally, the culture at Google is very snobby compared to other places I've worked. Managers love to reiterate lines like ""we hire the smartest people in the world"", and a lot of people seem to eat it up. One could argue that this is harmless placating, but the level of groupthink present all over the organization is appalling. Many even consider ""not invented here"" a legitimate reason to build something from scratch, even when there's more robust free software out there (I've been pressured into doing this several times, since the approval process for 3rd party code is so painstakingly bureaucratic).  Lastly, I don't feel valued, respected, or even acknowledged by managers. I end up working nights and weekends every week because of clear organizational mistakes being made by managers or other teams. I have been told personally by a manager that a reason for me being pigeonholed into a role I hated was because I didn't go to a top tier school (since another placation they often throw around is that Google is way harder to get into than an Ivy League school, this does once again seem irrelevant). The worst part is that most people don't listen about these things, the times I've told people that we are underorganized and it's going to cause problems later, the general response is to ignore it and/or not be proactive. Your processes are broken. Try asking about that more often and see how many people tell you so. True innovation comes from admitting something is wrong and then fixing it, not blindly running in one direction as fast as you can. Groupthink is the worst possible condition for an ""innovating"" company to have, and if you don't recognize it soon, nobody will want to work with you. Every passionate person you have that's not in a senior position is being demoralized into not caring, and you're the only one to blame.",2.084056,-7.720628,-0.0077007912223265185,0.08238329902118306,3.0,0.06192905733722061,0.5422740524781341

Just make sure you get into a good team with a good manager. Most Devs have to spend a significant amount of time in operation and supportive work, which can be a big distraction sometimes.  The operation mentality gets in the way of innovation too. Some managers are so afraid of making mistakes or causing customer complains, that they'd rather take mediocre baby steps rather than addressing the root causes. The company has a slogan: Amazon does not believe in Big Bang, which is totally understandable, but this is sometimes used as excuses for taking short cuts, making safe bets, and rewarding mediocre.  If Amazon pays so much attention to operation, you'd imagine that they would put much focus on QA, but ironically, QAs virtually do not exist at Amazon. The end result is that many Devs spend so much time fighting with the legacy system rather than building the new ones. I simply cannot understand the rationality of hiring top-notch Devs to push buttons, handling customer requests, and trivial bug fixes with over 6-digit salaries. Sure, any SDE job would come with a list of not-so-interesting tasks, but I haven't felt so mundane at my previous jobs, so I don't know.  Finally, the immigration service at Amazon is horrible. That only costs you a few thousand dollars, which is a tiny fraction of a SDE salary and your operation cost.

If you go through all the interviews posted at glassdoor.com and careercup.com, you should be fine. - Great co-workers. Team work is really good at Amazon and you see heros all around, constantly fighting the madness. - Product moves fast and very little beaurocracy (no three month long project reviews, you deploy the code and see what breaks, then fight to stabilize things overnight). I will speak for AWS because that's what I know. One word can sum up the work here - pager. Responding to the pager is what engineers are hired for. You do get to code snippets now and then, but in all likelihood, you will write more code during the interview than in your actual work at AWS. There is an elaborate system to track who's supposed to respond to the pager when, who all that person can then page when he's unfamiliar with the problem (happens a lot), how many pages were encountered during the day, how many pages were encountered during the night, what to do if you see the same issue when you get paged next. Everything, expect how to fix the problem that caused the page. Yes, that's discussed superficially at meetings, but then there is no one to actually go and do the fix, because all the engineers are attending to the pager, or waiting their turn to do so. People keep joining and leaving the team every month ( it's a ""revolving door""). At the end of my eighth month, I was the second seniormost person on the team. Most people who hang on beyond a year have under water mortgages or kids in college to pay for. If you do join AWS, don't at least buy that million dollar condo.

24717,amazon,2012,"Pro's at Amazon include great customers and some co-workers. There are lots of very smart, motivated, professional people at this company. Working with them can help you raise your game. Also, should you be both lucky and smart with your expectations, with the right if timing when joining Amazon you can make decent money over their 4 year vesting cycle. Thats provided the stock is low enough to see the effort pay off.  Oh, you can bring your dog to work.  I have no regrests for having worked at Amazon. I knew what I was signing up for when I joined. Downsides are many. Start with that you are working in dog-years. You will work harder then you ever have before. Next the number of not-so-great internal customers and crummy co-workers overbalance that of the good ones. A good size group of people at Amazon are overloaded, working insane hours to just keep ones' head above water. Next there is a much larger group that floats along, doing passable work and maintainig relationships to stay in place. Then there is a small number of ""chosen"" few, those who benefit from their managers favor with decent hours expected for work and favoritism for advancement. So those doing the majority of work are in the minority.  Another big issue comes up when reviews come around and a single digit percent of the population is to be managed out. This can have to do with performance, but it can also be that your manager just likes someone else better. To bad, but Amazon has to ""keep raising the bar."" The average employee may get a small increase and a little bit of stock. Those with favor from the boss get a nice batch of RSUs and cash, too, as a bonus (Dont let them tell you theres no cash bonus - its there just for a few). Just remember that if you are getting an offer from Amazon know that they will try to shill you coming in the door and screw you while you are there, So dont take the first offer. Make sure to get as much stock and base as you can because you will not see much of an increase over time, nor much additional stock grants even if you do a great job.  Then there are the managers and mid-level leadership. When I joined Amazon there was a good size population of good, even great, managers. Those who wanted to help those around them succeed. Over time these people have left, only to be replaced by the average Amazon manager. This person does not care about you. He cares about his bonus (see above). He wants his manager to be happy and show the love. You are just a way for him to benefit. This deportment of a manager is not uncommon, its anywhere. Its just that the bad actors have an added fuel of the Amazonian attitude.  The Amazonian attitude is a cocky, I'm-so-much-more-smarter-than-you, obnoxious, the world owes me attitude. Kind of like a smart mouthy kid who takes the ball home when he doesnt get his way. A majority of the managers at place really have this aura, as do many many others. The place reeks of this cocky snarkyness. And you'll be that way, too, if you work there. It creeps in and takes over. You might not know its there until your spouse tells you so. Then again you are smarter then your spouse! Ha! They couldnt get a job at Amazon!! You might not know you have the attitude until after you leave the company. Then its a hangover when you go to your next company. Amazon thrives on a culture of argument. You want to win? Better have good metrics and a stomach for confrontation. If you cannot argue well you will be eaten for lunch. At any and all levels across the company. That attituide doesnt work in the real world where you coorperate with your peers and co-workers, say please and thank you, are polite. Try some of that argumentive agressive manner with yor new company and it will be noticed in a negative light.  And then there is Amazon HR and recruiting. Amazon was at one time a great place to go to work and prove oneself. If you could make it there you showed to the world that you had great skills. Thats no longer the case. The team has grown huge and the bar for competency has dropped. The lower it goes, the more recruiters they hire. And the bar drops again. The chosen few I spoke of above is really the case in HR and recruiting. Sad, but true. Win your managers favor and you'll go far.  In sum my opinion is that Amazon is not a classy company. That venier of friendliness to the outside world hides the crass, boorish behaviors within the company. Want to work there, great! Yes, if you want to you can bring your dog to work, and/or dress like a street person. Just know theres a price to pay for the opportunity. Having a high turnover rate should alarm you. You are not raising your bar with ejecting a yearly set percentage of your staff. Especially since the replacements hired are like the interviewers and hiring managers: Average. Should be a clue, too, that to grow the staff you end up relocating so many people to work at Amazon. this due to a large number of Seattle locals do not want work at Amazon due to the poor reputation and those former Amazonians who refuse to go back.",2.1663342,-9.8595915,-0.00018881029052808372,0.07310698831164451,1.0,0.14915344328290753,0.493041403041403

Ability to move to several FCs within the network. See review titled ""Please understand what you are getting into"" The above review is spot on. The average Area Manager's total compensation package is $100+k/year. Take that number, divide it by 60-65 hrs average off-peak work week and 80-85 hrs average peak work week and be astonished at the hourly rate of pay. Yeah, that is why most managers never do that exact thing. The company is growing so quickly, they recruit recent college graduates. I have nothing against college graduates, an AM has to be one, but an experienced manager is now expected to guide 200 hourly associates and teach ""green"" managers how to manage. Throw in high production standards and other high stress factors and your head will spin. Amazon rarely gives yearly base pay raises which even begin to keep up with cost of living increases - they issue stock instead. I was the top performing manager at our FC and received a 1% pay increase. Interested in a promotion? Get in line behind the ""Pathways"" managers. These folks, regardless of performance, will be promoted or placed in the path of least resistance. Some were very good, but many more could not handle the daily stress of the shift. Out of the original 23 managers hired for the start-up, only 3 remain with the company as of this posting. We were to open the FC with 50+ managers, our first peak consisted of 31 managers, leaving those 31 to pick-up the hours of the missing 19. Please don't let the dollar signs dictate your decision. Sign on the dotted line and kiss work/life balance good-bye! At some point Amazon's growth rate will exceed their ability to hire experienced managers. Start taking care of your Area Managers, they are the foundation of the business. Without them, who leads the company? Certainly not the Operations Managers.",-20.166822,-10.28933,-0.09278891980803824,0.04981795855394039,1.0,0.12903401360544217,0.504421768707483

33586,amazon,2012,"Working for Amazon is great for the CV and if you can manage to stick it out for a year you will feel that you have performed a miracle. Most people don't last that long. Amazon truly did have the smartest people I have ever worked with, sadly with very little 'social intelligence' or any life outside of work, no time to exercise, socialise, holiday... makes you wonder how smart they really are? Amazon's long strategy to be the worlds most customer centric company is great, but only if you are a shareholder or customer. Employees are chewed up, exhausted and spat out before being replaced with a fresh MBA grad with fat loan repayments to keep up & no exposure to working for a decent company who think that the way people in this company behave is normal - it is not. Every single employee in Amazon is overworked and people are generally too busy to spend time with family, friends, exercise and have interests outside of work, let alone look up from their screens to acknowledge co-workers coming or going. Most workers eat lunch at their desk as they are too busy for a break. The majority of employees would not dream of leaving the office before 7pm, if you do this then your lack of commitment to Jeff's cause will be noticed. If offered one, don't take a blackberry or you will never get away from the madness. People who get on at Amazon are aggressive, know it all, blame culture workaholics, who will shift the blame on anyone but themselves and tear you to pieces as soon as anything goes wrong. Everything is a 'fire-drill' with people panicking and looking to apportion blame. You either have to adopt some of this negative behaviour yourself or you will become mincemeat. This kind of attitude would you get you nowhere in the real world but for some reason it is tolerated and encouraged at Amazon, just make you sure you unlearn this terrible workplace behaviour as quickly as possible once you have escaped. I saw at least 4 people 'disappear' during my time at Amazon, including someone who had relocated from abroad to work in Luxemburg who was fired in the most undignified manner. Employees who relocate and decide to leave of their own accord will be chased to repay relocation expenses. During an all hands meeting management sang the praises of people who had exceptional commitment to Amazon, one such person was specifically mentioned in front of the audience as a hero for still working from their laptop on an important project while next to the hospital bedside of their very sick child. This said it all, 'Amazon is more important than you, your health, your family and everything in your life'. Truly unbelievable and sickened me to the core. Don't be blinded by the RSUs (stock options), most people don't last here longer than a year. I heard internally that only 7% of people get the 4th year RSU pay out so you better be REALLY happy with your base salary and uncompetitive benefits package, 0% training budget and 0% chance of a pay rise during your time with Amazon. Also don't forget that you will be working double the hours of a regular job and that combined with the fact that the cost of living is extremely high in Luxembourg means your hourly rate will be peanuts. I read the negative reviews before joining Amazon and thought that 'it could not be THAT bad'!?. IT IS and more, so don't make the same mistake!! Jeff Bezos has been quoted as saying that people should pay him to work for the privilege or working for Amazon. This really is evident in the way that employees throughout the company are treated. I still do all my online shopping at Amazon, but I would not even recommend to my enemies to work there.",0.5980328,-13.88257,-0.009448244603394435,0.07531826403575828,1.0,0.07325766747376916,0.5469709856997992

Probably to curtail the already high churn and attrition in the company. (... in no particular order)  Management: - You don't need people management skills to become a people manager here. Which means, an MBA with no experience of managing, developing and dealing with people can become a software development manager. - Most managers are non-technical. They will throw a lot of hand-wavy stuff at you and expect you to get the work done. - Most managers lack backbone. They would take things lying down and pass on all the grief to the engineers.  Culture: - Employees are NOT treated with respect. We are people, not resources for you to move around. - Management is extremely political, especially the ones who are low on technical acumen. They frequently use politics as a way out. - No perks, other than a crappy medical insurance package.  Engineering:  - Extremely aggressive deadlines leading to poorly written and sparsely tested software. - Engineers do 24x7 oncall. The oncall is also a build and release engineer. They are also the first ones to deal with the customers (aka hazards of end-to-end ownership). - Operations consume a lot of time. They also randomize entire teams. Most groups are unable to deal with this menace. In other words, if you're working on a feature, you may be asked to shelve it for the next 2 weeks to work on a customer impacting issue. - A lot of last minute requests. This is mostly because of the sheer number of adhoc requests from other software or operations teams, and because of lack of planning for such adhoc tasks.  Career growth/development:  - Performance reviews are not transparent. Everything is driven by your manager. The HR department is a mute spectator in most conflicts between the employee and the management. - YoY increments in compensation are low (5-6%) - Long-time employees are paid less than folks hired from the industry. ""Loyalty is not rewarded"" - this is from the official handbook. - No investment in career growth. If you're a star engineer, you'll probably have a career path, but if you're not, there's no mentoring.  Hiring:  - Poor hiring standards. Amazon's bar is nowhere compared to Google or Facebook. The company has devised weird, experimental strategies to hire engineers. The center where I used to work grew at least 200% in four years. The # of incompetent engineers has also grown at the same scale.

Advice for Upper Management: Managers are people too! Our job as an Area Manager is to engage our associates, remove barriers, and solve problems.

33637,amazon,2012,"Great brand name that is recognised globally, it's likely you'll work with some of the most driven and smart people you're likely to encounter. This in turn can rub off on you and enable you to raise your game, at a cost. Amazon has the most selfish, individualistic culture of any business I have worked for. The working environment in Slough is down right unpleasant, over-cramped and dirty offices based in a down at heel area of town. The brand name is clearly able to attract some very smart people all hoping to get on the gravy train, but as the business has grown, the culture has become less friendly. Tenured employees are not appreciated and employees in general are entirely disposable. I have never worked with so many people that will happily stab each other in the back (or front) to get ahead. There is no fostering of team spirit or taking a genuine interest in people. No-one seems to have any life outside of work or take any interest in each other as individuals. There is absolutely no investment in talent management, talent development, or CSR. I find this unbelievable in a company the size of Amazon. The HR department contains the most useless group of individuals I have encountered, who seem to do little more than help manage people out of the business.  To survive at Amazon (and that is what you'll do... survive) you have to become an unquestioning drone, happy to work all the hours and meet all the demands on earth without reward or positive feedback. I find it hilarious the one of the leadership principles is 'disagree and commit', however doing so will get your card marked. I also find it hilarious that one of Amazon's 'peculiar ways' (of which there are many), is too not come across like the corporate borg. This place is more like the corporate borg than anywhere I have worked. Regimented leadership principles that you have to adhere to. Don't let wearing casual clothes to work fool you that you'll be playing table football in your lunch hour. 1. You wont get a lunch hour because the business is too frugal (tight) to hire enough staff. 2. There is nowhere to eat your lunch other than your desk, because the deli handling nine floors of employees is tiny. 3. Should you be able to get out for lunch, you have the delights of Slough high street to contend with.  I think the thing that is most depressing, is that the business is doing extremely well in these uncertain times, and yet there is no celebration of this, no lightheartedness, no fun. Just a relentless drive for growth with people under ridiculous amounts of pressure, trampling over each other to get ahead and sticking to cliques in order to survive. It's depressing that people have to act in such a selfish manner to succeed, and depressing to think that you have to abandon your principles to stay afloat..  It is easy to get sucked into the business and try and meet the ridiculous expectations and pressure you will be placed under, but the business can suck you dry if you let it, and spit you out without a thought. There is a very unpleasant core to Amazon.    business is full of Hard to say, Amazon is too smart for this to happen by accident.

So you get to work with people who you admire and look forward to working with every day. Its a team - Technology.

If you are building a system that depends on other systems at FB, be ready for them to change underneath you. Nothing stays the same for long at Facebook. Every layer of the stack changes, and changes quickly.  At the human level, the company has also grown very quickly which means many of the lower level managers are new or inexperienced or got promoted to management for being good with computers (but not necessarily with people). It can be frustrating to report to junior managers and/or people who are clueless about social skills. With that said, the higher level, more senior managers tend to be really good and their skill often ""trickles down"" in various ways. Shore up the lower level management situation. Get more senior people and people with better people skills.",-3.37889,2.6380837,-0.009280005737738498,0.026410405206232637,5.0,0.13252525252525255,0.47609690656565656

This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices. In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times  -Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this.  -You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based.  -Telus very strict scheduling environment.

36363,netflix,2012,"Free bananas, apples, coffee. Low priced soda. Free Netflix account. I worked with (not for!) some amazing people. If your supervisor likes you, you will be treated very well and have some degree of leniency when it comes to meeting stats and time spent on the phone. Pretty much everything else not noted above. Most days the ""What's working?"" list is shorter than the ""What's broken?"" one.  No communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix ""engineering"" or ""research"" teams don't give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.  Reps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.  The customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say ""please stay on the line for a one question survey"" and then promptly hang up on them.  There is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be ""coached"".  Coaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I don't really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.  I get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to ""leave it behind me"" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.  One last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs don't need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran?  Also, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they don't even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.  I've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them. This is simple. Learn to communicate. Start treating your CSRs like human beings. Stop encouraging CSRs to lie to customers. Tucking tail and rescinding your decision to split the company doesn't magically make you a ""feedback driven company"", it means that you got called out on BS and you're backpedalling.",1.3239504,-14.147899,-0.008008377939891082,0.08885174434508189,1.0,0.1287486471861472,0.4963419913419912

36365,netflix,2012,"It was an interesting experience working at Netflix. I was lured by the supposedly high talent density, solving great customer focused problems and bringing entertainment to people around the world at an absolutely unprecedented scale. I thought that technology would be used to solve difficult problems but in the end the problems to be solved are all around content, content, content. It is fun, though, to work at Netflix. The company is extremely open and transparent with data, decisions and the overall direction of the company. There are no secrets. It is very refreshing to see such an attitude, compare that to Apple. Yes, there are interesting things to solve in cloud computing but discovery, search, personalization, and the overall architecture of the Netflix website can only be described as patchwork. The people who are working on these services are stuck in their ways and are protecting their personal little kingdoms. Netflix used to be leading when it comes to personalization and other discovery mechanisms. It has lost its ways and now those areas are a few years behind the competition. On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface. Because Netflix does not believe in career development (active or through mechanisms like 20% time) for their people it is hard to keep up with the competition. Have a really close look at the talent in the company. There are a lot of people who are making architectural decisions who really shouldn't.

While you are placed on teams to help you deal with any obscure technical issues that may arise, the teams aren't very supportive or responsive. They love to BS in the chatroom, but when someone asks a real question suddenly it seems like no one is home. On the rare occasions when you do have an escalated call that you can not resolve, supervisors avoid your messages in order to avoid dealing with the dissatisfied customer.  There is very little positive feedback. On days when I did everything correctly - 0% customer dissatisfaction (by survey response), low handle times, etc., the supervisor never said a word.

Great products, and you'll meet a lot of unique and talented individuals while working there. When I was exposed to the corporate side of things when getting genius certifications, it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. The corporate and non-retail side of Apple is magnificent. The company itself is amazing, but the retail side of the company has all the cons of any retail job in the nation, especially concerning retail management, whose visions and overall attitude I would say often differs compared to that of the actual company (outside of retail). As the company grows larger and larger, the quality of employee that Apple has had to hire to keep up with business has had an impact on the quality of service in my opinion.  Another problem I had for a time was the social aspect of the store that I was in. Even though I was great at my job, if I wasn't a social butterfly that went out with the 'in-crowd' of my store's employees on a frequent basis, it hurt my chances of advancement (I actually had coaching sessions about this from management which is COMPLETELY ridiculous. For a time even though I had top notch technical and customer service numbers in the store, the fact that I didn't like to go out drinking set a promotion that I was more than ready for back a few months. But this is more attributed to the retail management side of things than Apple as a company). In most ways, keep doing what you are doing, when it comes to retail, stop trying to commercialize the retail store, which is what started happening over the course of time that I worked there. Also, I think some of the higher ups should take more of an interest in who is being hired at the retail level, as I saw a lot of people hired towards the latter end of my career that I felt did not have the ability to uphold the quality of the Apple brand at all.

Management knows it is an issue but ""can't seem to figure out how to solve it"" which in a nutshell means they are sympathetic but unwilling to do anything real about it.

Clothing retail chains do not reflect the type of environment that managers need to succeed with Apple. Speaking literally for multiple employees, there are/were managers that work(ed) at this particular store and held down the talent of some employees that were really special. Maybe the management felt threatened? Maybe they can't understand the true potential of these workers? Either way, I have kept in contact with these people that were held back from getting a chance to succeed in Apple, and they have gone on to be extremely successful! A.k.a, from the 3 I know who left from being held down by these team 'leaders', 2 are managers in their own career field (IT and Engineering), and the other owns his own business! Given the opportunity, I believe Apple would have been better off recycling its own employee potential, and should have given these folks an opportunity with other stores, or within their own store.  Honestly, I can point back to where Apple 'harvests' its management from, and its not usually from its own employees, but from other retail chains that can't touch the high bar to how amazing Apple retail really is. That is truly the darkside of some of these stores. Give your employees a chance! Your employees are pooled from the cream of the crop, and they certainly are great folks who want to make Apple successful. Keep a close eye on some of your managers, because it was seen quite often where there was rude and inconsiderate acts shown to some employees, creating a very hostile environment.

I was inspired by my leaders and in turn could inspire my team. We were in it together. :) There are many decisions that have been made to help the customer experience at Apple, but to the detriment of the employee experience. They have been layering on more and more task but not the labor to support it and expecting the same results in customer and employee satisfaction. They lack a consistent and structured way of building leadership talent within the organization outside of the ASLP program and it impacting the morale of the teams, because they see the lack of LEADERSHIP. The culture of fearless feedback needs to return. Surveys are not the answer and have become a passive aggressive way for your teams to share their thoughts without real dialogue. You are losing the team and you need to really listen to them. Be wary of the people you bring on from the outside, you need to be sure they fully understand and will protect the culture. The culture I knew when I joined is gone and I worry for Apple Retail. The loss of Ron Johnson is felt through out retail and you need to help the team through that.

49073,apple,2012,"At Apple we are constantly being encouraged to better ourselves through training and educational reimbursement programs. Apple takes great care choosing it's employees which results in amazing teams of people which are greatly diversified but yet extremely cohesive. Apple's absence and attendance policy is not lenient enough. It is far too easy to make an honest mistake like recording your next day's shift arrival time incorrectly only to find out upon your arrival at work that management made no bother to contact you. When you're an hour late at Apple you are docked TWO points for a single occasion. A third point with in a three month period puts an employee on final notice for an additional rolling six months. No late, no sick, no emergencies or Apple will terminate!      It seems that a week doesn't go by without some press release from Apple touting how amazing sales are currently going or recent quarter results have blown away last quarter results or how Apple has amassed even more millions to try and stuff into their already over-flowing coffers. Well, on the flip side not a week goes by in an Apple retail store where store management is pressured from above to keep the stores staffed with as few employees as possible. The word ""utilization"" is constantly heard in the back halls of an Apple Retail Store. The idea is that if the staff sees enough people per quarter, the store will be rewarded additional positions on different teams. For example if the Creative team has X number of personal training and workshops consistently throughout a fiscal quarter, an additional Creative trainer will be added to that team. The team's weekly goals are set before the quarter begins. The team then sets out at the beginning of a quarter under the ruse that if the team works hard everyday and achieves these goals consistently then a new position will open to help with the constantly increasing workload. One thing is for sure right now at Apple... More and more people are buying their products. Foot traffic is increasing at an almost exponential rate, yet quarter after quarter with all or almost every goal met those promised additional positions barely trickle in or fail to materialize at all. In the end the current employees continue to feel more and more pressure to stretch Apple's ""greatest resource, our soul, ...our people."" thinner and thinner to meet the increased business needs.      As an Apple Family Room Specialist I find myself coming in contact and interacting with hundreds of people on a weekly basis. During these interactions I may be fixing a device, replacing or swapping a device. I may be teaching someone how to properly use their device. Many times renewing a customer's faith in the product and the company that made it. The role of the FRS has many hats sometimes. If an FRS is Mac trained, but a Genius position hasn't opened up yet (see utilization rant in last paragraph) that FRS is expected to do all the duties a much higher paid Genius would have to do. FRS's are also required to spend a great majority of their clocked in time performing the duties of a somewhat higher paid Creative. All the training of the highest paid hourly positions, but your move from where you started at Apple up in the Red Zone as a Specialist back to the Family Room as an FRS in considered a ""lateral"" movement. Lateral??! How is this so? FRS's have to attend specialized Family Room Foundations training to even achieve the FRS title. A GYOG (Grow Your Own Genius) FRS has to take number of highly specialized certification exams before that FRS can take any Mac appointments. Again, the FRS trains, obtains specialized skill sets that are then often called upon because non-GYOG trained FRS's cannot take MAC appointments. The pay needs to reflect the training and know-how. Apple is capitalizing on this ambiguous nature of the FRS role. Check into any Apple store's Family Room and this fact is plain as day. FRS positions will out-number or even match the Genius and Creative positions when combined. Good job Apple! Way to get all that you can out of an employee without paying them a fair wage! Apple is in fact running two businesses in each Apple Retail Store. The first is sales. The second tech service and training. The sales side of Apple is sustainable. Prior to Apple's latest Genius Bar customer service debacle labeled ""Fast and Fair""... Apple's Family Room employees were employing a different plan labeled ""Getting to Yes."" The previous plan was a COMPLETE 180 compared to the current procedures that Apple is called ""Customer Service."" The previous procedures allowed us to replace or cover accidental damage one time on a customer's device. Mobile device or Mac. During the ""Getting to Yes"" period we made MANY people VERY excited and thankful that they made the choice to do business with Apple then and in the first place. That program spoke VOLUMES about what Apple was all about. Now... Apple has lost the human touch we had worked so hard to weave into Apple technical service. Sure, the Genius bars around the world were bleeding money because of all the free repairs, but isn't there something to be said the constant stockpiling and growth of Apple's cash reserves? Bring more flexibility back to our Family Room procedures! This no exception rule is ridiculous! Stop looking at just the numbers Tim Cook and start looking how those numbers can be balanced with customer satisfaction, customer confidence and their willingness to return.

Your computer screen is monitored, you keep a log everytime you get up to use the restroom, basically like a typical call center from home. - Customers: its not the Tech Savvy young people who call you, its the less experienced crowd who does not know the difference between a Mac and a PC, or how to turn on the phone, etc. You will get yelled at because you can't provide free support, you also have to sell AppleCare packages every month to hit your quota (yep, phone sales!) - Technology: You get an iMac to use at home, the soft phone and iLog (call logging system) breaks most of the time. You have to log everytime an error happens if you miss one your Manager would just blame you.. - WORK LIFE BALANCE + HEALTH: be warned, if you occur 3 sick days in 6 months, you are OUT. Yes, you get fired for occurring 3 ""incidences"" - which includes seeing doctor, if you're sick, or just need PTO. Vacation gets approved half the time if you plan really early, but only in certain months like October or Feb. -Have all the managers get on the phones too and actually experience it.

Very sharp people work there. The general attitude of my former colleagues is to think proactively to new trends and technologies and not be a follower. I have worked for competitors who always consider what Microsoft is doing with regards to adopting something new  When you work for Microsoft the respect you feel in a room among others in the technology industry is a nice perk The Dynamics division of Microsoft which represents the 2000 acquisition of Great Plains and 2002 acquisition of Navision has yet to completely feel like what I understand the experience to be in other divisions of Microsoft. The biggest thing I noticed is the leadership. There are many that are not the caliber of professional you would expect from a VP or GM of Microsoft.  The strategy of the Dynamics division is like dealing with an ADHD child. High-level strategy can change as soon as every six months and mid-level strategy can change as often as every quarter.  I have worked at Microsoft twice. The first time was as an employee of one of the above-mentioned acquisitions they made. It was one of the worst experiences of my professional career mainly due to the fact that Microsoft executive management allowed only one of the two ERP companies they acquired to manage the entire division and did not police them at all. My supposedly strategic team of 18 was laid off a few years later.  About 5 years later I found myself back at Microsoft Dynamics division with information that the internal product fighting was gone, so I thought it would be safe. Unfortunately the top management of my particular group was horrible and after two years I decided to leave again. I recently heard that HR finally acted on three years of negative feedback on these managers from their employees and removed them from power, but it was too late for me and many others.  The worst thing that applies to all of Microsoft is their annual review methodology. Each team manager is required to pick a percentage of their team for a high score, a percentage for a medium score and another percentage for a low score. Even if a manager had a team of superstars they would be forced to grade this way. It creates a lot of back stabbing and politics.  One last irritating thing is the blind loyalty they expect everyone to have toward their products. I understand the importance of supporting your employer by purchasing their products, but what if they produce inferior products? When the iPod first came out it was an unspoken taboo to own an iPod and not a Zune or some other MP3 player. Later when Microsoft got into the cell phone business they became very anti iPhone and Android. If they caught you with one you would no longer get your monthly $100 phone allowance even though Microsoft has absolutely sucked in this market.  Overall Microsoft is not the worst place to work and is probably great for some people (it certainly looks impressive on a resume), but I will not return there. Top management needs to get back to being the industry innovators instead of following Google and other cloud providers and Apple and Google in the cellular field. Everyone over there is very focused on getting into ""the cloud"", but it seemed reactionary.  The number one thing that needs repair is the method of annual employee evaluation. In addition they will need to start paying more competitive salaries if they begin to mess with the free health care benefit.",-12.145074,-4.209043,-0.07244972175914743,0.05633857521286529,3.0,0.03255840720126434,0.47466433037861616

59486,microsoft,2012,"Microsoft offers very good benefits (except for PTO, which is average), and the employee stock purchase plan, bonuses, and stock grants make leaving difficult. I worked as part of a small remote team which had become part of Microsoft via an acquisition. My team and I found that if you don't live in Redmond or Bellevue, it's much harder to feel included as part of the larger team and very hard to be promoted or recognized for your full contribution. They had a ranking-style ""bucket"" review system that meant that someone always had to be put in the ""bottom bucket"", an awkward situation for any manager. My team and I found that our manager preferred to put his out-of-towners in those bottom buckets, and it was harder for us to defend ourselves against this action from afar. We had to push to be invited to visit Bellevue or Redmond, and our requests were often delayed or denied, so it seemed like we were held in remote reserve for the convenience of being put in the bottom bucket. We felt like orphans, to be sure. Our boss generally did not like working with remote employees, and we could not have been more aware of that fact. As I was leaving the company, the ""bucketing"" review system was being phased out, but the overall Redmond-centric vibe in the company is still something to be wary of.

Vision for human capital has become somewhat hidebound - e.g. ""once a tech PM, always a tech PM"" Culture largely fear-based, which inhibits cooperation, team-building, max creativity and ROI. I saw the worst ""back-stabbing"" behavior during the two recent contract gigs - quite noticeable. Loss of strategic vision, especially technological, since Bill Gates' departure - witness, failures like Kin (a Windows phone). MS has lost a lot of executive talent which is has failed to replace, and has tolerated quite a few executives (I mean GM level and above) who should have been culled long ago. Lack of exceptional leadership has demoralized rank-and-file. A direct quote from group leader: ""Make the decision that insures I don't lose my job."" Yes, that was the sole criterion provided for business guidance. Back to basics: high tech is a human capital game. Everything begins and ends with your people. Your whole approach to HR needs a complete overhaul - - You need a (new) S or E VP of Human Capital and Organizational Development, and a strategy-driven re-engineering of all associated processes: planning, recruiting, compensation, evaluation, etc..

59598,microsoft,2012,"The pay is pretty good. Not the best in the business, but definitely above average. Same with the benefits. They really shine with the work/life balance. 40 hour work weeks are the norm (while at other companies its typically closer to 50 or even 60).  I also have to commend Microsoft for being very charitable, community-focused, and progressive. They match charitable donations up to $12,000, sponsor volunteer events and giving campaigns all the time, and extend benefits to domestic partners (among many other things).  It's not a terrible company, so don't let what follows color your opinion *too* much. I would still rather work here than most places, mainly because almost every large company has the same problems Microsoft has. However, a lot of the cons below would be solved simply by working for a smaller company, possibly a startup. The culture is very much ""show up so you can get paid"". Around 10% of the people here are passionate about their work, the other 90% just show up and may as well not even exist. Good code design, actually getting things done, and doing them correctly aren't priorities - management puts all of its emphasis on the concept of ""visibility"". I like to describe it as being the loudest, most obnoxious person in the room: screaming and yelling while flailing your arms around works. But honestly, you need to go to meetings, lots of meetings. And you need to ask questions at those meetings so it looks like you're participating. Even if you already know the answers (or weren't paying attention or are just plain stupid) and all you're accomplishing is slowing things down for everyone else. And if you have an opportunity to pick a project or team, you need to pick the one that people care about the most. Even though you're on the same team as someone else and even if you're less productive than them, if you're working on the high-profile project then you'll get all of the attention. Or ""visbility"".  Visibility is the only factor in promotions and bonuses, provided you get your work done. Went the extra mile? Did twice as much work as the other guy? Cleverly fixed a long-broken and frustrating system? Unless those things directly impact the visibility I called out above, no one above your management leve cares, so enjoy your average review rating.  Team budgets are also divided by the impact of your work. Teams working on lower-profile products don't get as large of a budget as other teams, so promotions/career advancement is slow because your manager doesn't have the budget to promote you. The quickest advancement occurs in the Windows organization. Xbox/Bing/Windows Phone are all young, but I imagine the same trend will appear there if they prove to be successful.  There are also a ton of (for lack of a better word) ""older"" people at Microsoft. Very traditional, 9-5 types that are *very* stuck in their ways. And a lot of them (particularly the ones in management) think everyone else should work the same hours as them. ""Flex time"" allows you to work odd hours (I usually come in around 7am because my fiance works mornings) when you need to, but it seems a good portion of the company hasn't caught up to the idea, and frowns upon it.  You'll see this at a lot of the old, big companies, but there is a lot of redundancy in management here. The sort of people where you look at what they come in and do every day and you think - couldn't they just have someone else do that for ten minutes at the end of each day?  It's a very reactive company, and takes too long to react.  There's too much red tape. Proposing new features or even getting rid of old, useless ones is a trying process and usually not worth it.  Management puts a lot of emphasis on ""training"" - both internal MS training and external offerings, but they're always worthless and if you never go to them people wonder why you don't want to broaden your knowledge.  If you're new, no matter how much experience you have you'll be treated like you don't know anything and need your hand held (no one actually read your resume except HR).  The hiring standards for teams outside the US are *much* lower (and I personally think they're already too low in the US), so if you get to work with them then prepare to be frustrated daily. Grow up. Be a *leader* rather than a follower. Microsoft is one of the most profitable companies in the world - it can afford to take risks (and I don't mean buying companies for 2-50x market value). It also doesn't need hundreds of thousands of employees. Cut the dead weight.",2.08894,-5.3305016,0.0020350390969075087,0.062354147361481885,3.0,0.0808500854190509,0.3874548854721268

The fact is that individual work requirements and deliverables vary so widely that it hardly makes sense to compare them to each other -- it's an apples and oranges exercise. Attempting to apply the mythical man-month to creative engineering roles is inherently folly.  Another side effect is that there ends up being a huge amount of collaborative and dependency overhead, which limits teams' agility and ability to deliver on short timelines. In turn, this prevents Microsoft from being able to innovate or even ""fast-follow"" in an ever more dynamic technology market.  Microsoft has huge resources and influence, but on the whole there are relatively few products/teams that are able to deliver real value to customers in a timely way. The cash-cows of Windows and Office continue to bolster the company financially (i.e. ""nobody ever got fired for buying Microsoft""), which is a good thing for keeping the company profitable and stable, but it masks the fact that it's a lumbering beast of a company that's finding it increasingly difficult to compete and stay relevant in emerging technology markets. Lose the stack rank, completely. Reward whole teams based on performance (strategic or financial, or some combination), and give more freedom to mid-senior and middle managers to reward individuals based on direct contribution to the products they own.  Senior- and principal-level managers often have great product design expertise and instincts, honed over years of good work, but this only rarely balanced with good people-management skills. Get serious about people-management at the mid-levels.

Reorgs take forever and leave you in limbo. Sometimes you can feel a bit lost in the enormity of the company and your division. Staying focused is a skill that is mandatory to manage your productivity against all that noise. The new review system is worse than the previous. At least we were awarded and assessed for contribution and potential. The what and how turns into a game of favorites. Promotions and compensation are sub par with other competing companies, waiting up to 2 years or more to see a level bump is ridiculous.

59704,microsoft,2012,"Lots of smart, passionate people. Great reputation and history. Great opportunities for future (Windows 8, Windows Phone, Xbox). Can find great spots to flex your strengths. Solid set of resources to tackle big problems.  Culture is more about what you get done than 'just looking good' (although the politics unfortunately corrode this 'pro') Too much of an emphasis on efficiency and not enough on efficacy. Senior leadership struggling to value vision along side cold hard numbers. Still see marketing as a cost and not an investment.  Career goal “having an individual impact”, Operating models, work flow, stale and ineffective process, duplication of roles, crossover of responsibilities resulting in duplication of effort and lack of accountability coupled with nonexistent budgets reduce ability for subsidiary Product Marketing to have an individual impact.  Many teams have a 'yes' culture and a pervasive inability of teams to work well together (I have experienced this far and wide).  Where there are people there are politics, however it is often chronic at Microsoft where those who crush others and take credit for others work (even their subordinates) are the ones who climb the ladder. We are then left with a leadership of ladder climbers rather than true leaders. People will follow true leaders and unfortunately there are not enough true leaders at Microsoft.  Deeply flawed review model that only allows the best to 'escape' to other teams.  Fix the review model which is a joke. Fix how we measure 'how' which as it stands only reinforces politics and popularity contests. Fix how managers vs. non-managers in the 63-64 band are measured. These should be crystal clear and documented types of impact and expectations. Change how the curve is enforced enabling teams to trade between levels and compensation buckets so that the appropriate message can be sent to employees vs. forcing the current curve on all organization as if they were all the same, which they are not e.g. senior vs. junior orgs, orgs with lots of high performers vs. those with average performers etc. We employee *how many HR* professionals they have to be able to figure this stuff out.  Career goal “increased impact through management and leadership”, Lack of mobility for ICs due to combination of flat org and lack of new blood/talent. In sub there doesn’t appear to be career progression outside of management. Often those chose to be managers do not appear to be in that role due to passion for managing and growing teams, or in the increasing their scope of impact, rather they appear to be there as it’s the only ‘way up’. You can’t run an innovative world changing company such as Microsoft as if it were a Wal-Mart. You can’t attribute a hard cost to everything, no matter how hard we try. Kevin Turner helped us trim the fat during a recession, now he’s just cutting into muscle. Operational excellence is all very good but Product Leadership and Customer Intimacy are two just as valid acceleration strategies. OpEx has only gotten us so far. Time to focus on our customers and products. Time for a new COO.  More of a focus on customers, employees, technology and the Microsoft culture. For Chriscap making good on his proposed changes – ensuring these land top to bottom effectively. A real focus on building our marketing muscle. Reduction in the flagrant nepotism certain leaders exhibit. A better focus on our customers (not just in EPG). More focus on the customers and products vs. our infinitely complex licensing models. Better clarity between sales and marketing roles (get “sales support” out of marketing!).  More accountability in leadership roles for success *and* failure.

Much fewer opportunities elsewhere. I work in the Silicon Valley office. The opportunities here are far fewer and at higher levels very difficult and frustrating. Almost every group in the Silicon Valley is a sub-group of a Puget Sound based group. At higher levels, way too much time is spent trying to communicate and politic with co-workers based in WA. This skill becomes more valuable than technical skill and is crucial for success in the Silicon Valley office. There is no such skill requirement for those based in WA, though the skill is rewarded.  The company struggles hard to break out of the mold that was used for its early success. There are far too few people doing and far too many people talking about what to do. The current development model of PM + Dev + Test + (operations) incurs way too much friction. Too many people are serving in far too narrow roles for maximum efficiency. Several groups have made efforts to make this better, but the moment that something (anything) goes wrong with a progressive approach, these efforts are usually scrapped.  Worst of all, Microsoft is failing in its efforts to be competitive for top-talent. The best new hires don't choose Microsoft and the stronger the employee, the more likely that they are just using Microsoft as a stepping stone to something far more lucrative. Microsoft's compensation system is not structured to reward the highest achievers sufficiently. As a result, they move on and leave the ""B-players"" to fight for the 225% of target bonus (10-30%) that is available to the best of the best. Find a way to do more with fewer people on all of the teams, and reward those people who remain successful with even higher rewards. Aim for a net-neutral compensation cost in the move. For example, cut every group by 5-10% of the people in the group but don't take the money out of the compensation pile. Challenge groups to find more efficient ways of operating and give that 5-10% of compensation back to the teams that make those around them better. More of that should be available to the upper managers to encourage them to take risks. The risk-taking culture in the company is dying. Everyone is choosing the safe path.

59834,microsoft,2012,"Good benefits and reasonable place to work alhough to make good money you have to work the system by staying for an extended period and a ""top performer"". See below how. Microsoft has a calibration and review process. There are also yearly commitments but they are a bit of a red-herring, although of course a newby has to actually do something initially. But really the main work goal is to network with peers and anyone that can can give you a positive review, remember you may need to reciprocate (even if it hurts). Kiss up to your boss big time, but remember he/she also needs positive reviews and so work something out on that front. The work is actually secondary to all this - thanks to all the newbys and contracters who do that.. The calibration process actually determines what you will be paid and and more importantly if you will survive. Calibration is where you will be compared to your ""peers"" to see where you sit in that stack. If you are bottom of the pile your are history and if you are top or near (say top 30%) you have hit the microsoft jackpot. But the calibration process is a bit like a lottery as you you will be calibrated against everyone in your particular business unit (at your grade) by management that may not even know you, and amay have there own personal favourites. That is why networking is such a big thing. The other part to this is there are quotas for each grade and there are currently 5 grades. This like a budget plan - 10% will receive 0 bonuses and increment and will be managed out of the company via a PIP (Personal Improvement program it means your gone) and 10% will be marked as the top talent. The others are the survivors with varying increments and bonuses depending on where they sat in the calibration. The people that succeed at Microsoft are not necessarily the most talented but the most able to work the system and have the most successful network to inflence the calibration. An indication of the kiss of of death is to stay at the same level and role - you are expected to ""grow"" and extend yourself. Most companies I have worked for previously would say if Joe does the same job well, and that is all he wants to do then perfectly fine, but not Microsoft. Assuming you stay and make it to a upper management level then will be a complete cat fight (usually hidden from the minions) - you will be well rewarded well but attrition rates are higher (look for the next VP leaving). But still Microsoft is very top heavy as has all those people that have worked the system - but where do they go? Eventually get sick of it all and leave to start a contracting company or a business to add value to the microsoft products they have worked on and hopefully have left contacts in the company to get that work.  Make sure you are working in a group that has business growth or else Micrsoft has a tendancy to ditch products and people when revenue growth stops. Work like a company that has integrity, don't just mouth the words. Get rid of the calibration process as this notion that people must be constantly moving to be successful is actually a detriment to successsful products.

If you're not working on the team or technology you are best at, you're essentially losing your skill set day by day. Create avenues for innovation programs at the ground floor level. Use the talent you hire for the strengths you hired them for. Excellent engineers do not always make excellent managers - foster programs that train your talent to become excellent managers (you used to have those programs, where did they go?) Allow for your people to have a voice. Use open conferences, open discussions and focus on making people talk about technologies and innovations. Get people out of their offices and talking, working in groups. Foster creativity, it leads to innovation.

59928,microsoft,2012,"I've been at Microsoft a number of years, and worked at 3-4 different places before Microsoft. I can honestly say that the people at Microsoft are the smartest, most wide-ranging in their talents and interests, and most inspiring people I've ever worked with. This place is just full of Type A people who have excelled at school, startups, sports, music, and life in general. It can be a little humbling at times, but it creates a really exceptional mix where you can do your best work and stretch yourself and learn something new every week. The company obviously went through a bit of a dry spell, with the difficulties in getting Vista out the door and the mixed response to Vista, and the company's well-documented shortcomings in tablets and mobile devices. But it looks like the company is really turning things around now, with a rock-solid Windows 7 release 2.5 years ago, strong industry buzz around Windows 8, growing enthusiasm for Windows Phone, Xbox and Kinect beating Wii and PlayStation, stock price up 20% over the past 3 months, etc, etc. So one of the best reasons to work at Microsoft right now is that the company definitely feels resurgent -- feels like we are getting a little spring in our step, and breaking through in some key areas that will be critical for future growth. Beyond that, there are all the usuals -- great pay, great health care, great amenities, great quality of life in Seattle, company is focused on staying lean and nimble, etc, etc... The Seattle location can sometimes make it tough, when so much of the industry and media attention is Valley-centric. Every group is so empowered and focused on its goals that it's sometimes hard to get cross-company collaboration on a project. The recent changes in the employee review and compensation process make me a little worried that we could be moving toward an every man for himself culture if they don't fine-tune some of the rough edges over the next year or two.

Building a business/partnerships/relationships and personal contributions are completely irrelevant at Microsoft, you are tied to a revenue # regardless regardless and compared to your peers regardless of geo/resources/customers/management support. Teams must all have a bottom 5-10% which are subject to job lose, regardless if everyone is exceeding quota objectives.

Managers are not leaders, they are not accountable for your failure/success unless they brought you on board and they will simply just not support you, no share helpful info, and will stack-rank you low against your peers until they manage you out and can hire/build their own team of friends. Management at Microsoft lacks ""leadership"". Instead of mentoring/developing/motivating/inspiring successful teams, management now relies on stack-ranking. Stack-ranking at Microsoft has no depth beyond a # and has pitted individual contributors agaist each other with no collective success and no ""leadership"" to cultivate an environment for success across a diverse team of talents. Microsoft managers need to learn the difference between being a ""manager"" and a ""leader"" and realize they have a greater responsibility beyond a spreadsheet... because behind those spreadsheets are real people-with real families-with real lives.

However, if you are not in the top 5-10% of the annual performance review curve, the rewards are substantially different and less impressive. Depending on the organization, there can also be high levels of political gamesmanship and favor currying. Many teams drive too much to advertise and evangelize the work they are doing instead of actually doing the work, and unfortunately it works for now (but it won't always). The annual review system still fosters a predatory competetive culture versus a cooperative competetive culture.

As long as an employee produces and never needs any more-than-perfunctory maintenence, you will be fine. However, if more course correction than that is needed (and over a multi-year career, even super smart people occasionally need an assist here or there), the philosophy today seems to be to cut bait and just bring in another body. Microsoft always has said they invest in their people, however their actions more accurately reflected their words years ago than they do today.

Sometimes the training seems lame, but it always forces you to think about how to improve yourself. This might be my favorite result of working here. No customer contact if you're a developer -- MS is just too big.  Development at MS is much more time-based than quality based. It's unfortunate, but that's probably the way I would do things if I were in charge anyway, as it makes good business sense. But it's frequently not very exciting.  MS doesn't seem to be a place you retire from. There is constant pressure to improve or leave -- and let's face it, we all have our limitations, we can't all be CEO. So you're eventually likely to be forced out in one way or another as you get older and get close to your potential.

There isn't enough top-down leadership that directs teams to all move in the same direction. What is termed giving responsibility to the lower levels ultimately results in individual teams doing what will position themselves best, and not what's in the best interests of the company. That's why you see some many conflicting or half-baked products out there. It's because some manager knew that getting his named attached to something new and shiny would do his career better than slogging through bureaucracy and resistance to partner with another team that has different priorities, in order to build a better experience for the customer. The structure of the company is built to produce software that does a lot but misses the mark, and to promote people who know how to work the system instead of create the product.",-7.063384,4.020257,-0.04022723673192482,0.006605444211056973,3.0,0.2712554112554113,0.4826767676767677

You can almost think of anything you want to do, and there will be training, mentors and opportunities available for you. The culture welcomes and encourages rotation. The annual review system forces all employees to a curve. A certain percentage must get a very poor rating every year - whether they deserve it or not. Depending on your group, this can lead to cut-throat competition, as people compete for a good rank, since you are pitted against your peers. This system rewards and recognizes self-promoters at the expense of quieter, but solid contributors. You never feel like you've done enough and can relax.  Poor work/life balance. Microsoft is stubbornly reluctant to open up to working from home, when many other companies have already embraced it. There is a well worn sentiment internally that we tout software that helps remote teams collaborate, yet we refuse to.  Consultants are expected to travel 100% (Mon-Thu) with little flexibility or sympathy for its impact on their personal lives. Management sentiment is that you can't complain because you get paid well. You do (and your bonus depends on your hours), but they get zero points for sensitivity.  Most of the pressure to be on site every week comes from our own management, even when customers are flexible.  Consultants have a quota of billable hours to meet annually. This quota does not include travel time, which you have to make up.  There is a strong Kool-Aid atmosphere. The sense of blind passion often feels phony, as if we're all trying to act out our slogan. Internal training videos remind us how excited we are about our products and what we can do to share that excitement. Probably because of the ranking system, people compete to out-passion each other and everything is ""awesome"". I've seen consultants express regret at the cancellation of a high profile status meeting. It just feels fake, but I understand where it comes from. If you're not passionate enough, you might not get a good rating. I don't think this is a heathy culture. Real passion and excitement comes with a counterdose of skepticism and criticism. The latter is conspicuously rare. Senior management must understand that merely soliciting feedback and holding open office hours is not enough when you have the cloud of a ranking system hanging over your head.

The product quality is improving and the ability for the products to interoperate has been improved ten fold in the past 5 years. Employees have early access to beta products and well as are provided a good amount of training opportunity. Benefits are generally good. HR does try to continually improve benefis to keep Microsoft at the top. Pay is good as well in general, it does depend on role and performance. Employees who are doing outstanding work are rewarded well. Employees who are not doing well are managed out of the company (Caveat discussed below). If you asked me these questions a year ago, I would answer differently. Due to recent changes in the review model, Microsoft is a less desirable place to work. The company has become excessively focused on metrics which detracts from focusing on the long term sucess of the company. The environment has become more cut throat and a higher stress workplace. Employees are constantly worried about being giving a low review score without much control over it. If you want control over it you need to work all of the time and then that does not even secure anything since situationalism. For instance, if your territory has budget issue in respective clients, or if upper management decisions to change review metrics part way through the year. Manager favoritism runs rampant in the company, it can have a direct impact on how well you do regardless of metrics. HR has covered themselves with a clause in the ratiing system, ""In relation to your Peers."" Let's say that you have a team of rock stars, not uncommon at Microsoft, of a pool of 50 people approximately 3-4 people will need to be placed into the lowest rating which means they will be on a program that will be difficult to get out of and likely asked to leave the company. Another 6 or 7 people will be rated just above the lowest ranking which will put them in a position where other groups will find them undisirable. Therefore, about 20 percent of the employees are labeled in such a way that they will have difficultly moving between organizations in the company. If you are reporting to a manager that you don't get a along with, your days will potentially be numbered. Employees should be treated as assets to the company not resources. If you have performance issues with employees, that should dealt with quickly and efficently. However, forcibly placing people into bracket either at the top or bottom will not have the disired outcome for the long term. It will not build you a heathly and diverse workforce incenting people and managers in the right ways. The ""Jack Welch"" mentality which seems to be at work here will backfire. It might appear to work in the short term, but will unravel by becoming counter productive in its attempt to retain the right talent over a duration that will make the company viable in the long term. The focus should be shifted to teamwork and building the best products in the industry by setting a high bar for performance. If everyone can attain the bar, then they should be rewarded. If people are not doing their jobs and performing well they should be managed out. Hire and keep good managers that can produce in the right way, get rid of others that are detrimental to the growth of the company. Additionally, hiring people is an expensive proposition, especially in customer facing roles. It takes time to get up to speed and build client relationships. When clients are happy, removing someone because they were ranked below their peers, but are still producing high quality work makes little sense. It is only disruptive to the team, customers, and stability of the company.",-14.22672,2.250177,-0.06733967473244526,0.007785650102318761,4.0,0.14548721340388007,0.5317063492063492

At the end of the day your manager would be trying to fit you within a curve. Also, even if you have done a great job through out the year that does not guarantee you a very good review as your performance is compared against your peers, in spite of the fact that not everyone might have done the same level/complexity/type of work as you did, which is kind of absurd.  2. The quality of work which comes to this (primarily) offshore based team has been detoriating over time. Although you might end up getting a Consultant title, most of the time you would end up working on repetitive type tasks (which are generally done by any other SI's with a larger team). Very less and rare customer facing opportunities.  3. Very very slow career growth rate within the organization. It used to be much better when the Org size used was smaller (in terms of people).  4. At times you are required to sign-up for some really unrealistic commitments, which you may not be able to meet or will just meet them for the sake of it (compromising the quality). 1. The people managers need to be more focused towards the overall development of the resource. 2. In lot of aspects quality has started to take the back seat, whereas quantity has more focus, which will only negatively impact the brand & image of Org in the long run. Focus on quality (more than anything else), I'm sure you don't want it to end up as a mere body shop. 3.

67084,microsoft,2012,"* Microsoft is an amazing place to learn from others and, if circumstances allow it, grow professionally within the company. * The company has above average health benefits. * Excellent Continuing Education and Self-Study Resources * Excellent Self-Service Mentorship Program * Overall compensation is above average when you add all the fringe benefits and services an employee obtains since Day 1 working in Microsoft. Many of the following observations are rising trends that in my opinion started after Bill Gates departure in 2006, and now increasing at a much higher pace ever since the company entered in a ""never-ending"" reorganization / reshuffling loop at the end of that same year.  * Middle management, in some groups more than others, do not observe Microsoft's code of conduct. They appear to exemplify the phrase: ""The end justifies the means"".  * Honest hard work may go unnoticed if you are not politically connected to the right people.  * Managers are empowered to decide upon their direct report's fate within the company - having almost uncontested authority to promote or fire anyone reporting to them. Moreover, the system lacks of appropriate check and balances to effectively apprehend potential managerial misconduct.  Therefore, the KEY to succeed and grow within the company is: Instead of looking for a new role within the company, you should always be scouting for good managers that could potentially hire you into their team. In other words, having a good manager matters more than landing upon your dream job.  * On several occasions, over a period of 6 plus years, I've seen how HR sides with management instead of objectively assess what could be at stake in any given situation or complaint. Employee morale and passion keeps declining - the majority adopts a ""See no evil, Hear no Evil"" attitude in order to survive or spare retaliation from management.  * It was of great disappointment not only to witness highly-unethical behavior coming from middle management, but to see how upper management looked the other way.  * Although Microsoft is still a great company to work for and to list in a resume, I would recommend that if looking for a new workplace, to look at other great companies that will probably enrich more anyone's professional career. If you are already working for Microsoft, then take pride in what you do while understanding that the company is going through a challenging phase - and always keep in mind that the best thing to do is to do the right thing. Uphold and blindly enforce the rules that once led the company into a path of great success, a place that inspired high standards & moral values.
