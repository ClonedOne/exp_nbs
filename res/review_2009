4655,google,2009,"There are many things said about working for Google, so it makes no sense to reiterate them, but yes the perks are great and the compensation is competitive, and there are very few places that are that much fun to work at!  What makes working for Google special is the projects you're working on, instead of re-implementing old concepts you can spend your time on working on new concepts that haven't been done before, if you're passionate about changing the world this is the place to do it at.  And the people you work with are just as great, incredibly smart and motivated and a real pleasure and inspiration to work with.  In the end, isn't that what's most important? Feeling that you're making a difference and doing something useful, and doing it with people you enjoy working with. There are a few people who've grown lazy or are waiting for their stock to vest, but fortunately they are a minority and in my daily life it isn't an issue at all .. it depends a bit on the team you're on though.  Also Google is the new favorite target in the press, while a huge amount of what is written is still positive it does sometime require shaking off some wildly speculating headlines and being very careful what you tell the press, if that's a part of your function. Keep it up! Google is an amazing company, with a very flat, fair and open culture with many of the best people of the sector .. keep doing what you're doing, and make sure that as Google grows we don't loose this magic touch in the process",11.920348,-0.043413468,0.03343336820201993,0.031055544284660726,5.0,0.28277957336780873,0.5549838478514949
4659,google,2009,"Yes, the food is great and the 401k match is amazing. The base compensation is not top of market. I'd say it's average at best, but what really makes up for it are the bonuses, bonus multipliers and stock grants, which you get EVERY YEAR. That's right, EVERY YEAR you get more shares, not options, shares of stock which are currently above $550 each. Bonus multipliers when the company does well are nice. Everyone in the company got a bonus last quarter just because the company beat its own expectations.  What has made Google really great are the brilliant minds that work there. Best machine learning people on the planet. Creator of the Python programming language. One of the authors of C. There are so many brilliant people at Google, and yet, the pecking order is pretty flat. When you start, you'll enter your Noogler class and be immediately overwhelmed since your class will have the top guys from Yahoo, IBM, Oracle and so forth with the same title as you - you'll wonder if you belong. Everybody you meet at Google will have been the best, most talented person at their previous organization. Somehow, Google has managed to preserve an open culture where people really aren't arrogant. I don't know where this ""arrogant Google engineer"" stereotype came from, because this is about as far from the truth as it gets. You will learn so many secrets it will blow your mind. The tools you have available are mind blowing. You get to dogfood and have your applications dogfooded internally long before they are released.  20% time exists! In reality it's never as sexy as working on Gmail, but if you have a passion, say, writing a MySQL client in Go, the new language Google released, go for it.  Google engineers can take time to attend classes to improve themselves. Google invests a lot of money in career development for their employees.  There's too much good stuff going on at Google to put down. I'm sure some of the other reviews will cover them. It could suck for you if you are not a developer. If you are a developer, you never have to worry about things like squeezing out money from your products, but if you're anyone else the pressure is constantly on.  The Mountain View office has the best vibe, and this vibe is missing from the other offices.  Honestly, I don't care about this one but not all the fringe perks are as good as the media makes it out to be. Massages aren't free, you have to earn credits. You get one a year on your birthday and these are often given out as prizes for internal contests. Dry cleaning isn't free. Etc.  You will be too busy to take advantage of all the perks.  Base compensation is not great, but Google rarely lays people off. Google hires people that want to do a good job, so this isn't a place where if you have a bad quarter you are gone. You simply may be passed up for bonus, which will suck. More strongly encourage mixing between groups. Invest more in classes and letting Googlers actually go to the classes.",1.7743818,-9.81502,-0.0010459307724190424,0.07922827822995543,4.0,0.27591563333088753,0.5456245261330008

Company reissues employee stock option to $308 recently. Bigger percentage of annual bonus compare to other companies I know of, $8000 per year 401k match, free meal and other perks. Company has the perception of being an innovative company. Friday TGIF with beer and wine. Engineers’ qualities are general fine. Many satellite offices so people don’t always have to relocate. For the first one or two years, you will be excited to explore the infrastructures, tools, systems and dream about a career path. Office environment – It could be very noisy and interruptive with 5 to 10 persons sitting in one room. It’s not the best setting for strong and independent engineers to focus and develop solid code. There are such engineers in our office that hardly able to focus and be quiet for more than 30 minutes, always talk loud and flatter each other. I am annoyed and disturbed on an hourly basis.  Project management: poor project management, lack of discipline and launch schedule. It’s very hard to estimate what and by when project will be launched. There is no one to enforce some discipline on code quality and stability. Launch delay quarter after quarter. When accountability finally comes and the project risks of being canceled, I see desperate launch push and poor code quality.  Manager role: Managers and directors usually stay far away from daily project management duties. Manager does not know what individual software engineer is doing so don’t slightly expect such otherwise you will be disappointed. Majority managers are not technically strong and write zero or negligible code. Don’t expect much technical inspirations or lead by example from your manager. You will neither see much career mentoring nor other “soft” help from the manager. I had 1:1 with my previous manager maybe 3~4 times during the whole year period. Despite being the “manager” of our project, all his involvement was showing up a few times in our project meeting and later claims making big impact to the project on his self performance evaluation.  Career growth: Despite the peer review model, the manager’s feedbacks appear to be what really matter. People that are vocal and suck up to their managers are very more likely to be promoted. If you are hard-working engineer that is able to and like to solve hard problems independently without making superficial noises, and expect Google to recognize your contributions, you will be very disappointed. I know some of such solid and senior engineers, about half of them already let Google. This is very counter-intuitive given the perception people have about Google.  Project and team: Google is primarily an advertisement (instead of technology) company. The web search infrastructure is awesome however only need a relatively small number of people work on that. The available projects for most people, especially in satellite offices, are limited and not technically hard-core. If you are a senior and talented engineer, you may not find a local project that allows you to focus and solve hard challenging technical problems. It also becomes harder to find other senior talented engineers that you respect and love to work on, given senior engineers are leaving and junior engineers are joining.  Engineering quality: I am disappointed with the code quality of my current team. Despite Google’s code review standard and practices, too many times people hastily touch existing code or add hacky code with no real testing. Such code checked in and deployed to data center. Overall it requires a lot more unnecessary iterations and bug fixes to stabilize the system. I don’t mind working 60 hours per week at all but it is frustrated to see most time wasted dealing with silly buggy integrated system. There is no engineering process to ensure code quality and stability or make a launch date more predictable. I see a general lack of engineering discipline and experience to implement very solid code from software engineers with no or just a few years experience.

4740,google,2009,"The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture. Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate. Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees. It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies. Following are some concrete examples of this:  Promotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews. In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers. Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don't like you, you have some work to do. Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer reviews from people in other departments. For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance. For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google. This is great because the percentage of ""cowboys"" that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google. It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere.  Career tracks fall into either management or individual contributor. This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while. In addition, it's not too difficult to switch between tracks. Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way to encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak. This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers.  You are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others' assessment of you. In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews. This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you've written it down. Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time. I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google.  Ideas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged. This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project. Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste). This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it's not directly tied to ""search"" but it contributed to the company mission to ""do no evil"" and it added to the green image of the company.  I could go on and on about culture at Google, and I've only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by ""culture"" at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment. From my four years of working at Google, I've seen the following downsides:  * In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within. I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized. In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale.  * Google ""over-hires"" people. By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education. So, for example, you would see software engineers being hired by support. That's just stupid. I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired. Sometimes it's possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained. Not efficient, and not effective. Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field. That's just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and accomplishments are recognized. Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years.  * Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get ""deep"" into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort. In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience. I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution. There is a sort of ""check list"" mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor. I think there should be more attention paid to contribution to items that are complex in nature and require more focused attention. for me, it's just frustrating, because I cannot live up to my own level of quality in my main project because of other demands from other projects. See my three downsides: look to hire from within, recognize significant career experience from new hires over academic, and consider the need for ""focus"" on particular projects.",-12.249074,3.2565298,-0.05236593920988552,0.014656580865481517,5.0,0.1276533516988062,0.5170511632536426

The culture is still entrepreneurial with a lot of change and innovation being driven from the bottom-up and raised to management at the national level. The brand is unparalleled in the advertising, online media and technology fields and is a brand that opens doors in almost all industries. Although Google is certainly experiencing growing pains as it transitions to a large company and tries to branch out from AdWords, it still earns its reputation as a great place to work. Google is a large company that desperately wants to behave as a small company. Although trying to preserve many of the values that made the company great to begin with is admirable, it is also a source of headaches. The flipside of change being driven from the bottom-up is that it often seems like the strategic direction of product launches / expansions are a little half baked. The entrepreneurial culture of being quick to respond also results in a lot of chaos. Playing the politics game is also becoming an issue for promotions since there are only so many slots in a flatter organization.

They not only issue students a great deal of responsibility, they also cater a great deal socially, organising many events (from mini-festivals, to international internship expos, to sea safari's in Dublin).  During the internship, I had many 1:1 meetings with my manager who offered good advice and feedback about the project I was given.  Great brand name on the CV. For my first week, I was given the task of working in the ""AdWords Approval Bin"" - a place where all automatically disapproved ads are kept and individually screened by Google employees. Many interns were given this for a week or two. Some people apparently spent half their internship doing it. Its not challenging nor stimulating - its very repetitive.  Although they do give interns big projects, from my experience very few of the projects (especially if they are focused on AdWords) will be implemented.

7709,google,2009,"Free food, cool perks, 30"" screen, smart people. Great positive environment if you are in one of the few projects with an excellent manager. Brand name: it will help a lot to have Google on your resumé when you'll run away. Most managers are jokes and if you are not their pet employee will barely know you exist. This mean that on quarterly and annual review your manager will inflate the work done by his favorite employees and strongly back their deserving for a bonus, promotion etc, while having little to say to the committees about the value of your work. If promotions are rare and reserved for a select few, raises are almost non-existent and far below inflation.  20% time mean you have to sleep less and work more during the week and forget about weekends. The running joke is that 20% percent means you work 20% more time than the current 140% time you spend on a fictional 40h work week.  Taking vacation lower your performance ratings resulting in lower bonus and less chance for a promotion or raise. Same goes for sick days, parental leave, or even for being unreachable on a weekend (while not on call).  Some of my coworkers had to complain to HR about their managers and got little support. HR would not recognize any wrongdoing and downplay issues as personality mismatch and misunderstandings. I've witnessed situations unblock with HR only after a VP was contacted for help by the employee. Get back in touch with the grumpy people, they are saying out loud what the majority is thinking silently. Of course you'll have old timers that are in a niche and know the right people to love how they are being treated, also you have the happy newbies that are not disappointed yet of not being recognized after a full year of hard working. Grumpiness is usually dismissed as 'entitlement' from some employees, but these same employees accepted lower salaries to join Google in exchange for working in Lala Land, of course they are grumpy when they wake up.  Make the career development efforts real, making bigger promisees without actually delivering real results will just frustrate the employees more. Develop and facilitate exchange programs between roles, but not limited to 10-20 people, that's not how you satisfy 10000 unsatisfied employees. Requiring that you be a top top performer in your current role is ridiculous, if the employees want to try something else it's probably because they not so happy in their current role and not performing at their full potential.  One way to improve career development and work life balance is to have *strong* incentives for managers to truly support *all* their employees to do 20% time, career development, work life balance. Also force the manager to take their vacation days, instead of setting the benchmark of working all the time. A manager that lose several his direct reports in a few months and unable to hiring replacements should be harshly sanctioned, not promoted.  Conduct surveys more often, one Googlegeist per year does not seem to help that much when it takes so much time to react and see the results. Open the committees to silent attendants, so employees can see how the process truly works, instead of hearsay and the 'official' guidelines. Create incentives for work/life balance, it's fine to reward the workaholics but too much of it, as it is now, destroys team morale.  React *now*, it will be too late after mid-september when I predict a massive exodus of under-appreciated talented people.

7716,google,2009,"I've also heard about how Google's stack ranking-based review system is obsolete and is an unfair way to rate employees. I suspect that most of the people who complain fall on the low end of the review scale.

I am also one of those people who delights in knowing that there is always someone smarter than me at Google that I can learn from. Since I'm always learning from someone, I'm always improving, and always holding my own in the stack rankings. Google does not and should not reward complacency. While I'm sure the review process can be improved, I've also witnessed that it has been slowly evolving for years so I'm content that people are working to improve the process.

Is Google a utopian work envionment that dishes out exorbitant salaries to anyone who walks in the door? Of course not. Can it improve in how it reviews and compensates employees? Of course.

7717,google,2009,"My story is a little different than most others because I was a temp worker for Google, testing search results for a year. I enjoyed the work a great deal, there were always new interesting things to test, and I got to see things like Maps and Timelines long before they were released to the public and help make them better. The pay was reasonable - $15/hour working from home - and there were good bonuses after a certain number of hours had been completed, or occasionally given for working on specific projects. There were two major downsides of doing temp work from home for Google. One was the astonishing lack of communication. This shifted a little while I was working there, they began developing a sort of report card system so that we could see how our rating work scored compared to previous months and how we were doing overall. But while I was there, that system only worked for a small fraction of the projects I was working on, so it wasn't particularly helpful.  More to the point, there was no positive feedback given to anyone at all, and communication between employees seemed to be discouraged - two classic characteristics of a dysfunctional work environment. Occasionally if a rating was very far off of what they were looking for - usually due to a typo or misclick - they would send it back with a warning saying so, but that represented the sum total of feedback given. Personally, I found it very difficult to work with no input about whether they wished I were going faster, whether I was going faster than my peers, whether I was doing a great job, or - most of all - any input about how to improve in general. Sure, it's a year-long temp job, but one which can potentially be repeated after another year has passed - and besides, who doesn't want to receive positive feedback and learn how to improve and receive more? I guess more importantly, who doesn't want to know what the expectations for their work are??  The one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences.  The other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn't get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really, I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls. From what I have heard, communication and job satisfaction are a growing problem everywhere in Google, and as with any large corporation this has the largest effect at the bottom of the totem pole.

25012,amazon,2009,"Pros  For someone leaving the Military, Amazon was a good place to go. They aggressively recruit and find new talent. It made finding my job here very easy. The base salary is a good wage and if you plan on sticking around, the stocks and bonuses are very good. The company does grow every year so there are new opportunities elsewhere in the company if you are willing to move. Cons  There is a revolving door for both managers and hourly associates. The leadership structure is extraordinarily flat, leaving almost no room for promotion for the hourly associates. As for managers, a lot of their aggressive recruiting currently is focused almost entirely on MBA students who enter at the base management level and then get auto-promoted on a semi regular basis. This is as long as they don't screw anything up too bad.     The 401K plan is terrible. It matches 1/2% up to 4% (in other words you put up 4% and get only 2% match). You are only vested in the plan after 3 years which is longer than the average young professional stays at a single job. When the annual review comes around and compensation is increased, it is always at the cost of another pay. So if you get more base pay, you get less in bonus or stocks and vice versa. The only way to make more then what you are currently making is to get promoted. As somebody on this site already mentioned, the only way for this to happen is to work so much and long that senior management feels sorry for you.     The company also somehow manages to mess up the ramp up to the holiday season every year. Even though we have multiple planning meetings before and after peak, we are not able to staff correctly. It is mostly due to the companies unwillingness to have one extra employee rather than be short by 10. This leads to managers and associates alike getting burnt out during peak. Advice to Senior Management  Communicate with your associates more. Rethink not having more intermediate leadership positions. These associates who fill new slots will get valuable leadership experience and will be monetarily compensated for their more difficult work. Then they might take more pride in their jobs and they will do them better. It could also lead to more internal promotions.",-7.19308,-13.755027,-0.0446771172165227,0.0438756268725932,1.0,0.03151691845569396,0.5228199691464996

25030,amazon,2009,"Amazon is a very decentralized company and silo'd company, so many areas are great for developers and managers to work in. In these good areas, devs get: * A lot of freedom to do the right thing * Great support from upper management * The ability to experiment with new and interesting technologies * A strong commitment to building tools and infrastructure to make life easier for devs  As a manager, if you're in these shiny areas, you own your project, soup-to-nuts. You will work *with* program managers and product managers, not for them. It isn't an easy environment to manage in: you're generally expected to do a lot of things that other companies use TPMs for, but I personally find the challenge very rewarding. Amazon is a very decentralized company and silo'd company, so many areas are essentially rat holes that developers can easily get lost in. Most of the negative reviews are probably from those areas, and they are every bit as bad as you might imagine.  Rather than repeat the bad, I would encourage anyone looking seriously at Amazon to ask a few things of the developers (not the hiring manager) that they talk to: how often are you on call? How often do you get paged? What kind of schedule does this position require (45 hour weeks? 60+ hour weeks?)? When was the last time you worked a weekend when you weren't on call? How much legacy/technical debt is the team responsible for? And probably the most important question of all you have to ask yourself: is this team solving problems that are interesting to me? The teams that aren't are teams you will never be happy at, no matter what the rest of the environment is like.  The final tidbit that does somewhat makeup for some of the less ""optimal"" teams: Amazon has a policy where anyone can change positions after they've been in their current position for a year (provided you don't get a negative review). So even if you don't like where you're at, you can always move, which is great if you don't want to lose your vesting stock grants. We measure success and efficiency on so many dimensions, I think it would be worth taking a deeper look at what makes a successful development team inside Amazon.

Amazon loves to celebrate all the new people who have joined since the last company meeting, when most are just replacing others who have left.

25071,amazon,2009,"In a lot of ways, Amazon's weaknesses are great reasons to work there. It's a frequently disorganized company that does high tech work on a discount retailer's margins, so there's plenty of opportunity to take on complex tasks, self-initiate projects, drive them to completion, and work across groups. One thing that's basically guaranteed is that your job description doesn't cover everything you will have to do, or will have the opportunity to do. Also, it's fairly hard to get hired there--their interviewing process is nightmarish--so you do get to work with some very smart people once you're on the inside, and have great opportunities to create new products and drive concrete solutions to complex problems. At the very least, it is a very creative environment.  Once inside the company, you also have a lot of opportunity to change rolls. After a year, you're welcome to start trying to interview with different teams for new positions, and there is even the opportunity to move overseas for short-term assignments. Pay: Amazon doesn't pay especially well in terms of salary. They have ""total compensation"" which probably includes two years' of cash bonuses after your start date and a package of RSUs which really don't start vesting for two years. My ""total compensation"" was $10K higher than my salary, which isn't bad but leaves you at the mercy of the stock price. Advancement is slow, aside from a nominal COLA-like raise once a year after reviews, it can take a few years to get promoted a single level within the company, and even then the raise may not be that impressive. Basically what it comes down to is, your salary when you enter the company largely determines what your salary will be during your career there, they're mostly going to reward you with RSUs, not raises, which are really intended to keep you at the company longer.  Advancement: This is a complete mystery to everyone involved. Three-plus years and I never figured it out, except that it has to do mostly with your direct manager. They're responsible for representing you in the process, so a sleazy manager who promotes you heavily is good to have a review time, but a disinterested one or a bad communicator will basically leave you hanging. Sadly, in my experience, this is how advancement and reviews work at Amazon, they don't have much to do with the quality of the work at all.  Management: Management is totally mixed at Amazon, some are great, some are terrible (in my experience MBAs are let run amok, and seem primarily to promote one another, at least in my group--we had a bunch from the same school). Some people get micromanaged, some are left to their own devices. As a matter or practice, Amazon hates managing people--most managers have no more than three or four direct reports, so there's a lot of mixing things up on teams: senior employers get one employee stuck under them and that sort of thing. That's one of the main reasons the experience of management can be so mixed--there's so many people managers who may or may not actually be assigning you work that it becomes a matter of personality.  Environment: The workplace is weird at Amazon--it's aggressive for sure, but not exactly a boys' club, so that's a plus. It is a very accepting of diversity place to work. But overall, there's a lot of confusion. They're constantly shifting levels of management, and theoretically everyone ""owns"" a core set of tasks or products or whatever, and there are channels that are supposed to be used to communicate with other owners and teams (""up and over""), in practice, this rarely if ever works, and if you want to be successful you have to friendly, reliable, and willing to take on other tasks for other people and work constructively with others, because frequently employees simply get together to solve simple, short-term problems and completely circumvent management (who prefer to have lots of agenda-less meetings to deal with problems). In that sense, Amazon is an extremely political place to work, because you constant risk stepping on someone's toes, crossing an unseen boundary, or things like that. If you're not a communicator or not friendly, this may not be the place for you. It's also a company that's basically relentlessly positive--it's typically bad for you to ""go negative."" They don't like to blame individuals for problems, even big issues are typically dealt with with a meeting where all the stakeholders get together and divvy up blame so that no one's left with all the responsibility. In a lot of ways this is good, but by the same token people's unwillingness to risk seeming negative creates an environment where there's a lot of evasion and frequently an inability to hold poor performers accountable for their work, particularly if they're gifted at skewing metrics in their favor. Remember, it's a political place to work, and if you can't explain something to a manager in a Blackberry-friendly format, they simply do not care to learn.  Career Development: Aside from the fact you'll get great experience, learn a lot, and have a great thing to put on your resume, Amazon is a horrible company for career development. Lots of people leave after only a couple years. The weak pay scale means that you can get paid more with the experience you get there, while Amazon is largely incapable of communicating anything about career development that's useful. There's lots of talk about it at review time, but no follow through. There's virtually no internal career development opportunities, especially if you're not a developer. That said, it is a company that invites moving around internally. After one year, you're free to look for other positions in the company, and most employees are perfectly happy to sit down for lunch with you and discuss what goes into their job and what their team's looking for. So basically you have to network the rest of the company if you want to get anywhere, but be aware--changing jobs does not by any means equal pay raises or advancement. The divide between senior management and the people doing the work below is a gaping chasm. The company really likes to believe that Amazon has a horizontal rather than vertical structure--that there aren't a lot of levels of management. In practice, this is sort of true, but you will rarely if ever deal with your team leader's boss at Amazon. There may not be a lot of layers of management, but it's definitely stratified. Having been at the bottom of the chain, I saw quite a lot of brown-nosing going up the chain--frequently managers would work long and hard to produce theoretically objective reports and metrics that obscured complex problems. Surprisingly, in the management, there's a real opposition to complexity. If it's not possible to put in a Blackberry-friendly email format, they honestly don't seem to care about it until it blows up in their face.",-2.1528761,-3.1016216,-0.020847430613262687,0.03551328393186083,3.0,0.09331722614617351,0.4956666286929443

Innovative department structure: The two-pizza team structure is innovative and offers a fair amount of departmental autonomy in theory(does not always work in practice) . If you prefer(as I do) an agile developer run process, Amazon has the advantage of not imposing counter-productive heavy processes. Developers have considerable autonomy to complete their assigned job on a day to day basis, though expect to be blocked ruthlessly and unreasonably if you try to be innovative.  Developers treated relatively well: You will get your extra flat-screen monitor on demand, no questions asked when your manager wont. Your manager's digs will not be much better than your own.

The philosophy seems to be to mindless pressure the employees to improve ""productivity"". Amazon seems to do this way beyond the optimal point. This may be a trait of Jeff's that filters through the organization and manifests in a distorted form. The death march feeling is always there and morale is poor. 24X7 pagers are common but you may not be told in the interview process.

25081,amazon,2009,"Amazon is cutting edge, innovative, well recognized, and a market leader. They have shown the world they not only can survive amongst a very competitive landscape, but thrive in a down market. That is due to world class operations, relentless focus on margin improvement, and a very frugal internal attitude. As others have mentioned, due to the speed and lean environment, it's somewhat in a disarray internally which leaves mountains of opportunity for self-starters to make immediate impacts to the bottom lines. Opportunities to move within the company are good and encouraged which expose you to the full scope of the business thus deepening your understanding of how all the pieces fit together, what works, and what does not. The chaotic lean environment. On the pro side it leaves loads of room for opportunity to make a difference, which is possible. Just when you think you've made a difference by performing 15 different tasks to accomplish a goal (10 of which were not really yours to do, but you did them because there was no one else to pick it up), everything shifts in frequent re-orgs. Resources are lost, roadmaps change dramatically, documentation is poor to non-existent, which causes lost momentum that sucks the life out of you.  The lack of processes and routines. This is not true for 100% of the company, but is for many areas that one would think a company of 10+ years would have nailed. The constant reorganization of teams and leaders breaks any continuity that was established prior to the reorg. I was dumbfounded when I learned that a certain team in the company had absolutely no idea of the steps it took to issue a payment to a supplier. I think they thought it was all black magic. Project processes were another area that some key development teams made up as they went and changed quarterly. This created loads of knee-jerk reactions for many teams impacted across the company and challenged goodwill with internal relationships.  HR could care less about employees. Loads of lip service from the HR teams to make you think they care. Like many other groups in the company, their individual teams don't seem to talk to one another, or know each other for that matter. It is as if each team has blinders on and they only know and perform only their function in strict confines. There is lots of ""that's not my job"" attitudes. As an example, I witnessed on more than one occasion where great performers took international assignments only to return to leave the company because the company did nothing to help reintegrate the employees. What I heard is that HR managers and recruiters did nothing to assist these employees returning from their assignments, each one saying it was not their job. It was left to the employee to figure it out themselves. So after the company spends tens of thousands of dollars to move staff around the world yet the company expects nothing in return? How dumb is that?  Below market pay. Amazon is known for paying below market in terms of base salary yet expects people to work at least 50 hours per week. Many teams due to them being lean require 60+ hours a week. HR sells the entire compensation package with stock which can be great in a up market and if you live in the US. The odd thing is the mixed message they send with it: the stock makes you an owner of the company but because they call it comp, they expect you to sell each time you vest. I would rather have a larger base pay.  Amazon is no different than other companies in that it has it's own dysfunctions. If you have an iron will and a high tolerance for stress, you will do well there. Use the company as much as it uses you and it will be a happy relationship. It's not ""Day 1"" no matter how many times you say it. Those days are long gone.  Get a succession team in place for Jeff. Having a single person steering the company based on his whims of what gets resourced and what does not creates too much churn throughout the company. It seems that some in senior leadership roles act as if Amazon is still in start-up mode and wants to do lots of different thing marginally rather than focus on doing fewer things top-notch.

As an engineer, you have a vast amount of resources and tools to get the job done and the infrastructure is such that you don't have to bug IT to install this and that on your servers (unlike other companies). Your team takes ownership of almost every aspect of your product, so there is a lot of opportunity to improve how it runs with limited red tape. There is a huge emphasis on working on large-scale systems which is both fun and an educational experience. As owner of your product, your team will also respond to downtime, most likely with a pager rotation.  Depending on your team, you might experience some micromanagement from the Senior Management, but in my experience it happened on an occasion rather than constant basis.  Also, sometimes the autonomy that teams have can be detrimental to cooperation. Some times work is duplicated instead of shared properly.

25120,amazon,2009,"Amazon has quite a lot of smart people, and they're given free reign to solve problems the way they think best (after all, they have to deal with the aftermath). The result is a streamlined, low effort, build/deployment system, fairly low bar for building new services and tools, and the opportunity to try new things in a safe manner.  the technical environment is top notch, and the important parts are implemented well enough (always some room to improve).  Amazon is obsessed with metrics - when a service is deployed, part of the process is choosing metrics and monitors to ensure that any problems are caught automatically and fixed, due to the good tools, patches can be pushed out in hours, and rolled back in minutes, so responsiveness is expected.  Senior management communicates fairly openly, the CEO fields questions at the quarterly meeting, and welcomes hostile or difficult questions, which surprised me. At a divisional level, I always had a good idea of where things were headed and the priorities. Amazon will eat your life - pager rotation sucks, and if your service needs babysitting, you may not have an ops team to handle the general things. What this means is that a lousy service will take your free time and interrupt your sleep one week out of 6-8. This would be as expected for a lot of things, but some services are naturally chatty (external systems, upstreams that file a pageable ticket to find out why your service is acting up, etc.). In addition, the workload can be high if you find yourself in the wrong place - choose wisely.  The downside of free reign with teams is that there is often little consistency of behavior, as each team implements what it needs, this can cause problems if you need something not offered. It also impacts crosscutting concerns - coordinating multiple teams is almost impossible.  Payments is a high stress area, as is anything that supports warehouses. Having been in payments, it's getting better, but I didn't get along with one or two of the managers, I got a bit burnt out, then was denied vacation that I desperately needed and tossed on a deathmarch project., so that colors my views a bit  Amazon has cheap benefits (frugality is the watchword, but it burns a bit when the most significant bennie is a bus pass). On the flip side, you are paid well if you do well. Not a lot - planning for a post bezos world is important, as is ensuring that the leadership is strong, but I haven't run into too many problems of their creation.

Many are shoved, but many top notch people leave of their own volition. People who seem to be highly valued and an integral part of the work culture will one fine day simply disappear. They hire mostly specialists and maintain a very lean team. Competency alone does not suffice for job security. They will let people go once their project is completed if there is no immediate need for their specialty. They pay very well, but load engineers with high amounts of work. Because the dev team is kept so lean, there is little opportunity for moving to a different group and there are few growth opportunities. It is highly political in the management ranks and lots of jockeying for position, surprise surprise. That is par for any billion dollar company.

No advancement outside of the call center, and the advancement within the call center is pretty competative. Also the ""company values"" of taking invoation from anywhere in the company is a little bit of BS. I and others have made recomendations that don't leave the call center to corprate. I have even been told by a team manager to not waste my time thinking of call drivers or to come up with ideas as ""people with advanced degrees are already doing that."" Reevaulate the team manager positions. I believe most are a hold over from when the call center was ran less well a few years back. I would love some other outlets of employment provided to those within the call center.

The people driving these changes will try to convince you that it's positive, innovative, progressive. I say those people are just coming up with ways to make themselves look like they're working hard.  Granted, there have been some positive changes. But the recent reorganization that occurred with the latest shift bid? I used to have a competent supervisor who would help me when I needed it and who knew I was competent enough to handle most things. Now I have a supervisor who knows that I've been here two years and that my scores consistently put me in the top 50 performers ... but she tries to get out of taking escalations by giving me ""tips"" to de-escalate and telling me to go back to the customer with some compromise they've already declined. (Gee ... I think I have a good handle on how to de-escalate a call by now. If I'm asking my supervisor to take the call, I've done everything I can and the customer has asked for the manager. Just take the flippin' call, because sending me back onto the phone will just make the customer angrier and make sure they give a ""no"" response on that customer satisfaction survey. Awesome.)  This latest re-org seemed to be completely geared toward shaking up teams that had just gotten into their groove, my old team had great combined scores and even though most of our shifts didn't change all that radically, we all got split up. It seems truly unnecessary. If it's not broken, stop trying to ""fix"" it. Change for the sake of change is a waste of resources.  Stop treating your front line employees like they're expendable and they'll become more invested in their jobs. You've got some great performers in Hillsboro who get treated like trash.

In May 2009 Netflix took away sick/vacation hours and provided employees an additional dollar an hour pay and then advised all employees to open up their own savings account to save for unexpected days off. Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work (even if you provide a doctor's note). In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work. Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service, however has reduced it's training too only two weeks. One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls. The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers. The turn over rate is ridiculous. I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time. I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given (which is based on call volumes and business needs only) or I can quit. Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well. Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months, which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for, and no room for disscussion. So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job. Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment, which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit. One day they will tell you you are doing a great job, the next you will be let go. Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008. Roads were not plowed, public transportation was not running, and yet you were let go. People were in accidents trying to get to work. Other's they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift. Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice. It wasn't just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone, they only had specific hours in which had to be filled. My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT. Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs. Overall it's just really sad because this job was and could be fun. It's about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming. Still it is a call center and those jobs aren't always the best, however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess, the job is terrible. It's not even something you can count on because you don't know when they will fire you and for what. Invest some more time in actually keeping decent employees instead of degrading everyone who works there. Most of the employees have college degrees and years of customer service experience. Netflix is known around the world for it's great service. Great numbers and feedback come from happy employees, not from those scared every moment that they are going to be fired next.

36483,netflix,2009,"Netflix has nice, fancy offices in Los Gatos. They have good snacks. They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business. Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.  Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.  It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.  Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.  Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them. The key problem with Netflix is in their HR policies. Netflix needs to establish formal job responsibilities for all employees, establish goals for individuals, and measure employee performance against those goals.",-10.61706,-7.224119,-0.04666887795473112,0.04965307187037823,1.0,0.19929630152456243,0.550155605264301
36484,netflix,2009,"You are part of a team that is at the leading edge of a cool entertainment paradym. Reed Hastings, the CEO, is probably the CEO that I have most respected in my career, and I feel he pretty consistently makes good decisions and moves the company in the correct direction. Netflix has a very quantitative approach to almost everything, including detailed user testing for their products, so there is a lot to learn about that. The other employees are generally cool people, and fairly smart in general. The user interface aspects of the website are strong, so again, there is a learning opportunity. The company wide meetings are fun, and entail good communication. In the website development group, there is two week development cycle. That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks. This has a few consequences. One is that there is a high percentage of overhead (testing and release stuff) compared to actual development time. There is not much time for software design in such a scheme, there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click. Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates. The performance policy is that anyone who, if they quit, would not be attempted to talk out if it, should be fired preemptively (a hair trigger threshold for firing, basically). This creates a chilling effect in my opinion. I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being (farily apparently) fired. This creates a bit of a yes man environment, something that Netflix would deny (perhaps even to themselves). There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions, and decision making is very top down, with the resulting motivation hit that entails. Even going to a three week release cycle would help things a lot. The counter argument is that that would lead to more pressure to have inter-release ""patches"", but I think the overhead percentage would drop a lot (like 50%) and that owuld make it worth it (if you don't patch a bug for a 2 week cycle, do you really need to patch it for 3?

Netflix feels that it pays its employees well and that that will make up for these short comings, not sure if that is 100% true in all cases. There is a fair amount of career advancement available at the lower levels, but it is pretty thin at the upper levels such as director & vice president. Not sure the pat at or above market value for employees is 100% true in all cases. In general, senior management has their act together pretty well. Few companies can look in the mirror and make the same statement. I think Netflix could do better at developing internal talent.

Cafeteria food costs $$$ - it's not free. Many departments, and their VP's, directors, and managers have unrealistic expectations of their employees. Particularly on the hardware engineering side of Infinite Loop (buildings 5 and 6), people get driven very hard and are regularly expected to work weekends.  I've witnessed age discrimination. On multiple occasions, co-workers over 50 were laid off without warning. I assume this is a routine pruning to let go the people with the highest salaries, but it always feels kinda wrong to me. My department does regular layoffs, maybe 8-10 people get dropped every 2 years. At the same time, we're always hiring. Our use of layoffs seems like a disingenuous (disingenuous since we're hiring simultaneously) way to drop poor performers.

This is made evident through its incentive bonus plan. You can earn a max of about $500 per month based on customer feedback. Exact amount depends on customer ratings and number of reviews received. However, management makes it clear through periodic reminders that if you miss any time at work for any reason, you are displaying a poor work ethic and will lose your earned bonus. A sick day costs you the entire bonus for the month, even if it's the last day of the month and you were about to qualify for the maximum bonus. Lateness to work for any reason, even a legitimate one like a car accident costs you a significant portion of the bonus. I have been with mothers as they sobbed in the break room, because they have to leave work in the middle of the day to take care of a sick child, knowing that they will lose their bonus money and will struggle to be able to pay the child's doctor. Apple management actually states in writing that ""it is always your choice if you don't come to work and you are showing a poor work ethic if you don't"". Legitimate sickness, legitimate child care issues, any legitimate reason for absence is not accepted. Because of the significant drop in earnings, people usually don't stay out when they're sick, colds and flu are rampant in this workplace. Furthermore, the requests for feedback about your work that Apple e-mails to customers do not mention your name, or the topic that was discussed during the telephone call. Quite often the customer reviews someone other than you, e.g. a previous agent they were dissatisfied with, or a Mac Genius at the Apple Store you referred the caller to. So even if you did a great job, you get a bad review on your record. This reduces the percentage of good feedback for the month and drops your bonus. Apple does not remove these mistakes from your record. Management says ""you get some good ones and some bad ones."" In other words, tough s***.

The biggest downside to working from Apple has to be the overcrowding on the main campus. They're building another campus, and they've leased a bunch more space, but new hires are starting to double up and the on site cafeteria has become a madhouse.

On some teams, the expectation is that interns won't make a real contribution, and that your internship is just a public relations sales pitch to potential future employees.  The company culture is quite quirky, it seems that many employees aren't genuinely or wholeheartedly invested in Microsoft or the project their working on....evangelize Windows Mobile to your co-workers during the day, and play on the iPhone after work. Perhaps it's just about a nice paycheck and excellent benefits package.

However, you do have cutting edge stuff, which is really cool. Getting into Microsoft can be hard. Make sure you are thoroughly prepared and have done a lot of research. Sadly, the parts of Microsoft I saw have a lot of politics. Tread carefully, and ask others more experienced than you for advice. Teams or groups tend to work on overlapping tasks, therefore you have to fight for your patch and, sometimes, it isn't about getting the job done right, it's about getting it done first, and publicizing that fact. Because teams are graded on a curve - 10% lowest performaners, 70% in the middle and 20% high performers, you are effectively competing against your own team throughout the year. Make sure all the managers in your group - not just your own - know about your achievements. Reorganizations and restructuring are the order of the day at Microsoft. Learn to go with the flow as the change happens and create a new niche for yourself when the dust settles. Management should stop constant reorganizations. They are destablizing, costly and negatively impact customer experience (both internal and external customers). Even a radical move, like freezing all reorgs for two years, would be a good idea.

61092,microsoft,2009,"The benefits were decent. The pay for a summer intern is above the industry standard. There is a lot of respect shown towards the work of all employees and interns alike. Everyone is doing real work. No micromanagement at all. I was only told once in the beginning I was kind of expected to be at work from 10 to 4, however, I repeatedly showed up at work at 1 p.m. and there was not a single remark about it. (Of course, it was my problem when I had to work on some weekends to have the work done, but again, nobody was counting when I was working and for how long.) Very open structure, a lot of communication going on (not necessarily a plus for me, but Microsoft is very communication-oriented). Great technology. Everything is optimized. Like, you think it might be a good idea how to improve something: signs in your building, meeting schedule, some internal rules - you send an email, and you immediately get a friendly response, and people start working on implementing your suggestion (or disucssing it) as long as you want it.  Seems to be very fair for reviews, promotions, salary increases, etc.  If you are invited for an on-site interview, you will get reimbursed for everything. You can negotiate another day in the hotel, negotiate where you want to fly from and to, ask for another 5 free taxi vouchers, etc. They don't care what you where for the interview (or when you work there). They don't care if you have a weird haircut or sexual orientation. Only your skills, your passion for technology and for the customers, and your enthusiams matter. A lot of appreciation for the good work you do. Work was not challenging or interesting enough. A lot of code that is just doing routine things. It is not just Microsoft, however, it is necessary by the nature of the work. I am just not so much of an engineer, my background is in math and theoretical computer science, so I enjoy interesting things where you have to think, not just seeing technology work.  You have to be excited about your work. You do not have to work 14 hours a day (or even 10, really), but you do have to be excited and want to learn new technology, get a better developer (or a better Microsoft developer, more specifically) or getter tester, or manager, etc. This may seem like a good thing (and it really is!) --- but this is also somewhat forced. You have to identify where you want to grow (when you work there full-time) in a written form, then the company will help you - coach you, move you to another project, etc. You cannot just say ""I just want to work here for my 40 hours and get paid"". You have to find out yourself what you want to do. You have to load yourself with work, come up with new ideas, take the initiative, etc. This is required. So they are requiring and taking some of your emotional or spiritual energy in this way.  Too much admiration for Microsoft. Gets annoying to see all those monitors and posters and emails, advertising, how happy is everyone is at Microsoft. Even though it is not far from truth, a lot of people are very happy and very excited from working there.... - but this also gets annoying. Seriously, I cannot stand some many people claiming to be excited about their work every day, everyone from smiling drivers of the shuttle cars on campus to those working in the cafeteria, to researchers, developers, managers... It looks too good to be true, made me feel uncomfortable.  During my internship I was not given enough information on what was expected of me. It took me some time to understand that people just expected me to take the initiative. For example, they may not tell you ""you have to do it by next Friday"" --- but you will have to ask ""what do I have to do and by which date?"" If you don't, they will think you don't know what's going on (because you don't care to ask around) so not interested, or you are not a productive worker. They will find somebody else to do the job, or the project will move slower (they have many projects, sometimes 2-3 teams, doing the same thing, so at least one can succeed :)), and you will get a not-as-great review and may be eventually asked to leave. Although, I admit, this is fair in a way. If you have the initiative, go for it.  A lot of emphasis on getting the work done (which is good), but not as much on making people do what they are good at. The responsibility is totally on you. You have to figure out what you like and what you don't, what you are good at or not good at. You have to take the initiative. (Then, in many cases, you will actually be able to move to a position that you want.)  Many developers, testers, etc. are, it seems, not too great in terms of their skill, as Microsoft is a big place. However, talent is always recognized, and people are always trying to get better. If your background is limited and you need to learn a lot, but Microsoft still takes you --- then prepare to work a lot, too. It may actually be a lot of hours every day. (Yet again, nobody will count, and you can do it at home.)  Redmond location - there are some commute issues. Microsoft is working on that (like their ""the connector"" is a great thing), yet this will always be an issue.

The processes and the logistics of the processes are communicated really well to the employees to websites, wikis, and shared documents that are easily accessible. - There are tons of communication going on in the company. Each of us has instant messaging client on our machine (Office Communicator) and we chat with each other on daily basis. We also send emails like crazy, which is much better than not knowing what others are doing. - The salary is well beyond the average salary in regular tech companies. The salary for an intern is also well beyond my expectation. - Managers are required to give assessment of performance of the employees. In turn, employees are supposed to give assessment of performance of the manager. This creates a positive feedback loop in the company, and everyone learns from each other. We also review each other's code and each other's design document, in order to help each other improve. - We have no work hours. We only need to get done with our work, and that's it. It's up to us whether we want to work 9am-5pm, 11am-7pm, 7am-3pm, or working from home, etc. Things just have to get done. - We get tons of benefits and free sodas. - The diversity in Microsoft is amazing. Tell me one race, ethnicity, or religion, and I can always find a Microsoft employee that has the chosen characteristic. It's surprising even to me how much I feel at home at Microsoft. For you who love the startup-like thrill and excitement of being able to contribute a big chunk of a product, you may not find Microsoft the perfect company to work with. In some teams that are currently developing prototypes for a cutting edge product, you may find a startup-like culture in which everyone tries to be as creative as possible and contribute as much as possible to the design of the product. However, once the design is settled and becomes more mature, it is necessary to have a well-thought, highly structured process, in order for the product to make it on time, on budget, on quality bar. Then, you may have to get involved in this highly structured process no matter what. It is good to have structure, but probably it is not for everyone. One thing that I would love to see is more presence of the high managers in our daily work. It would be great if the managers would give much more presentations about where the team is heading in 2-3 years, or what are the most important priorities for our customers we need to address, or other high level stuffs that are not necessarily the employees' main task items day to day, but will be highly inspiring to have.

There are several big downsides to the Company. First it takes time to get things done at Microsoft, and there is quite a lot of unnecessary processes. This is a combination of the size and scope of the company and a result of the DOJ consent decree. Second, while the company is filled with smart people they are not all necessry working towards the same goal and thus 1+ 1 does not equal 2, but instead less than 2. Third, time can fly by while working at MS. Product release can take upto 3+ years, and in this time you may not get promoted. (often promotions are linked to shipping). Thus at the end you may find that you career has not moved very far. Fourth, the company is known for reorganisations. Again this maybe necessary for a company of the size of Microsoft, but it can be a huge distraction, as everytime there is new leadership, you have to schedule reviews, and change the plan fo record.

The result is a glut of products that are introduced to the market with an 'if we build it they will buy it' mentality, yet any half decent b-school would use the same approach as a series of case studies on what not to do. - the layers of management, particularly on the product development, is unacceptable and counterproductive. They require a minimum of 40 people - 30 of which are layered management and 10 that actually do any real coding - to start building anything. The result is enormous budgets and excessive timelines to deliver final product, and all the management overhead pushing back and forth to stretch out budgets and timelines but spending more effort to justify their existence rather than value add. Compare this to most nimble development houses today that can do great work with a fraction of the people, money and time. - the wealthy need to go - hords of senior management down to front-line managers that hit the jackpot during the 90's at microsoft are still there simply collecting a paycheck.

And by the way, the recent job cut announcement is a joke. Merely appeasement to wall street but in no way gets to heart of the problems that I've laid out here. Job cuts/turnover should start with top management and decisions should be independent of incompetent and corrupt management who ax fall guys to protect their own butts since they have no accountability.  Flatten the org, especially development. Have all mgmt people re-interview for their current jobs, by people they don't know or currently work for, esp where team morale is terrible.

Full-time employees get very good health insurance. Cafeteria food is good and there is a reasonable variety, though as with anything it does get old after a while. The various campuses are generally nice and most of the buildings have enough windows to avoid the feeling of working in a basement. Depending on which group you are in, you may get to work on interesting new products. Most managers are extremely flexible with regard to the time of day you work. Working attire is essentially ""come as you are."" I have worked at Microsoft for many years, first as an FTE then as a contractor (v-) so I have seen both sides of the coin.  Middle management is made up almost entirely of engineers instead of managers. While it can be nice to have managers understand the technical aspects of a project, very few good engineers go on to become good managers. Unfortunately, Microsoft almost never puts managers back into an individual contributor role unless the person specifically requests it, meaning bad managers get shuffled around leaving discontent in their wake.  Work-life balance can be seriously out of whack in some groups. This goes beyond the normal crunch-time chaos, multiple projects + hardware development builds every 4-8 weeks can easily lead to 6-12 months of 60+ hr weeks. Expectations for FTEs are always increasing, making it that much harder to maintain a work-life balance. Whatever you did to go ""above and beyond"" in the last review period becomes the minimum bar for the next review.  The review system fosters a competitive, rather than collaborative, environment. There is little incentive to help peers succeed as each person is stack ranked relative to the others in the group as ""assists"" aren't tracked or measured. If something goes wrong everyone scrambles to find somebody to blame instead of figuring out what happened and pull together to fix it.  With the economic downturn, MS cut contractor pay by 10-20% across the board. At the same time, most groups have limited contractors to 40 hrs/wk, putting lots of people under financial stress. Some managers are expecting their hourly contractors to put in an extra 10-20 hrs/wk, unpaid, to get the job done.

This new way helps new employees have a baseline with examples of technical, customer connection, soft skills and teamwork, and other categories for what is expected.  Free drinks does not make a job ""better"", but from what I remember they were a trend setting starting this practice a long time ago and many dot-coms also did this and bested it with free food to boot.

Regardless of your tenure or experience, I think many benefit from the ability to pick a mentor and get unbiased advice as an ear to listen to your questions. Most hiring managers and recruiters pitch ""very easy to move around within Microsoft if you want a new challenge"". Well reality is if you are even half way decent, and have been in a team for a bit and are adding solid value, chances are you will have resistance when you try to leave. Or better yet like it has happened to thousands of employees, you actually get ""blocked"" from interviewing in another team. It has gotten better though in that you don't get blocked much anymore as they finally put accountability on managers to stop this horrible tactic of doing this and now a VP has to approve a ""block"", so that manager has to explain why you are soooooo valuable and non-replaceable that they can't let you go. The ""old boys club"" is alive and kicking. Too many old folks who don't like change, and they have been around for 20+ years nurturing the old school management philosophies of the 80's that don't work as well in 2009. Many should be gone and retired by now as they can, but they stick around and make silly decisions. Also ton's of incubation teams working on pet VP projects, in the red for 3+ years. The company and Ballmer need to start trimming these (these are different than what the research does) and start being more fiscally responsible as economic conditions will dictate.  L67 or higher and you are a bad manager? You get crappy manager feedback, an HR generalist might get involved to collect feedback from a collective disgruntled team of folks who report to them, and that person is now in a different part of the company off to be a crappy manager to another set of folks. Also the company is very very good at taking very smart folks in Engineering and making them now a mediocre engineer who is a sucky manager and leader, has poor soft and interpersonal skills and no matter how much ""training"" they go through, they just don't have it in them to be good at understanding what it takes to be accountable for the work of others who now work for you and needing to lead them. ACCOUNTABILITY STINKS all over the place with our Sr Mgmt, the biggest problem I see is this ""A"" word.  Partner level folks? This topic is very touchy given their astronomical pay over the other 99% of the folks (average pay around $500K with SPSA stock grants and bonus) and the value add they have other than being around for a long time. My recommendation is that Senior Mgmt should explain to all employees what it means to be a ""Partner"" and the criteria for how these folks attain this level band and more importantly the review system for them, as right now they have a bad rap (I'm sure the folks who are actually at this level are not complaining).  I'm not sold that Ballmer is 100% at fault for everything that goes on in the company, in most places you put in place leaders and trust them to tell you what is going on. We have two sides of the execs in the company, many worked in Sales/Marketing jobs, and just as many if not more rose up through dev mgr and GPM roles. But you see a lot of people want him to take action and fix problems sooner. The part that makes me very angry are the comments year after year he makes about the stock price doesn't matter.

61327,microsoft,2009,"Microsoft's size and product diversity can provide a lot of latitude for a variety of different career experiences. When starting, you'll be expected to stay in-role for at least a year, but after that (depending on the group) you can explore elsewhere within the company. I believe this is the best way to get the most out of the ""Microsoft experience"". In Microsoft, moving around is good, for a number of reasons. Note that team culture within MS differs widely. Clarify your career goals well, within your own mind, then work hard to get there - leveraging the existing HR processes.  As an FTE, the benefits package is the best you'll find.  The people at Microsoft, in general, are great. Overall, they are quite smart, and famously passive-aggressive. Don't be intimidated, but also don't over-assert yourself - just be relaxed, knowledgeable, open, vocal and confident. Make a point of getting to know a lot of people. Microsoft culture is not as pragmatic as it used to be, and is becoming less so every day. MS people used to want to ""change the world"" (which they did), but now it's much more about ""playing the game"". The creeping bureaucracy is not, as some say, the inevitable result of growth - but rather the result of a loss of cultural momentum. As the old-timers leave, and new people join, the culture is shifting - slowly, but inexorably (like global warming).  In years passed, it used to be okay to openly challenge virtually anyone's rationale, as long as your argument was strong. Now, that could be politically unwise, and could hurt your career. Bad news used to ""travel fast"", but now it is more often suppressed. The true impact of modest reportable achievements tend to be exaggerated, often to a great extent. A project with minimal value but great visibility can do a lot to help your career, but the reverse will generally not.  Regardless of recent HR attempts to improve team collaboration, the element of intra-team competition remains as strong as ever, even within the formal reward structure. Helping others on your team will usually not impact your review, but ""game playing"" to improve your visibility at the expense of your peers is usually rewarded. This is true at every level of the company. Microsoft is not unique in this regard - but you should be clearly aware. 1. Drive user experience in an obsessive, even fanatical, way. 2. Don't allow ""canniballization"" concerns to inhibit product innovation. 3.
