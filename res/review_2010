You'll be given considerable responsibility, and paid accordingly with some pretty terrific perks. Google is fighting the 'law of large companies', and is doing pretty well but there's a certain inevitability afoot too: Over the four years I've been there, I've noticed scaling back of perks (and also at times a sickening culture of employee entitlement), a steady rise of red tape to run a scalable service in the production environment, a certain amount of stiff corporate speak and a uptightness over branding, image, and in some cases (though definitely not all) an aversion to risk taking has to some extent dampened my enthusiasm a little bit. Still an amazing place to be though. Consider more career paths or guidance for senior engineers... I get the impression that this is where careers go to plateau. I'm 27 years old, and at this level I find myself compensated very well, and with more responsibility than I know what to do with, but I get the impression my choices are being an individual contributor for the next decade, or vying for a management spot. Even so, this is I think a problem for software engineering in general, and I think Google does a much better job at making it a liveable and enjoyable situation than any other large company I can imagine.

4608,google,2010,"Having been at Google longer than 9 out of 10 employees, I still feel the business poses me with fresh challenges and terrific learning opportunities virtually every day. I have been able to pursue several distinct ""mini-careers"" at the company, with promotions and transfers available as I hit major project milestones. The career environment is ideal for someone who thrives on complexity, who takes initiative, and who communicates well and constantly with technical collaborators.  I feel that management empowers and facilitates individual contributors. You have a fantastic liberty here to challenge how things are done (whether bureaucratically, technically or in product design). Expect fast and constant change. You can step up and drive that change, too, if you have the chops -- the courage to express a coherent vision, and the stamina and depth of skill to follow through. A high impact project at Google can affect a global user base of hundreds of millions (or is it billions now?), and can shape the course and direction of whole industries. You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship. And while search is critically important, we do so much more.  When it works, it is a total jazz. When it doesn't work, well, you fail fast and try something new. Everyone outside tends to ask, ""What company will be the next Google?"", but internally we remain quite ambitious: ""My project at Google will be the next Google!""  The people here are great to work with. Passionate about ideas, compassionate toward others, with many innovative superstars, and a culture that celebrates diversity. Of course, there is some politics, human nature and fallibility -- as you will find anywhere -- but I find the overall environment positive and well intentioned. Working at Google has a stiff learning curve, and it can be challenging to ramp up and get your footing here -- especially if you have been doing software development 10+ years elsewhere and are accustomed to being a big fish. In you aren't on a very short list of luminaries (e.g. a Vint Cerf), then respect and influence have to be re-earned from scratch based on what you do at the company. Your past merits may have helped you get in the door, but inside they buy you nothing. So, to thrive here you have to grow and sustain some inspiration about what's possible, to keep your head above the daily grind of routine work.  Working at Google can isolate you from the global technology community, as well as sometimes from our users. We have our own technology stack and internal lingo, so systems and methods learned here aren't always transferable. We exist in an extreme media spotlight, in highly competitive markets, dealing with sensitive information, so we are very cautious about sharing anything externally. The culture tends to be inward facing: everything is on campus (the Googleplex) -- meals, entertainment, perk, education, tech talks -- so why engage outside of the bubble? Our approach is to solve everything with automation so that the system works on a global scale, but human-to-human customer service does not ""scale"", and so is sometimes given short shrift. I find that Google's leadership is willing to make hard choices with integrity. They are an inspiration -- and they are always challenging us to reach further, try harder, think more deeply.",-7.917451,11.777675,-0.050461754995022194,-0.004849521628138322,5.0,0.13434176519997418,0.46849324804548703
4609,google,2010,"I think most ppl r proud of working for Google. I was too...at least for the beginning of two months. So, I don't need to repeat the good things about working for Google here. But, remember, all the good things are mostly posted by ""software engineers"". They are like king of the world in Google versus operation engineers (including me) are like slavers of the king. Google, fortunately, is the worst company I have ever worked for. It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.  1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.  <to be continued> I thought Google was not a place for the politician to play games with every day.

Groups are all very autonomous, so individual engineers have a lot of control over direction of the group and responsibility for the success of the team. The company assumes you're going to be thinking about more than getting to your current milestone, and expects you to think big and aim for large goals.  I've found the other engineers sharper and more accomplished than anywhere else, everyone has shipped great things before, and they're eager to do it again. It's not surprising to be working with a 24 year old who sold a company, two senior engineers who were VPs at startups, and a well-known researcher in a particular area. It's a cross between grad school and a hundred little startups. I haven't always gotten guidance from management about what's important or how the teams need to work together. Like grad school, there's times where it does feel all your responsibility. Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go.  Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams.  Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn't as focused or controlled as in other companies, there's really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It's not a place with the razor-focused direction.  Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers. This is great because you're recognized for your engineering work, but bad if you aren't churning out enough code or if you're not having enough impact on the rest of the company. Initial titles get assigned 6-12 months in when you're put in the same pool as existing Googlers who are up for promotion. If you don't match up to them, you go down a slot - no difference in salary, bonuses based on new level, and any mental scars from being judged unworthy. It doesn't really matter, but if you're at Google you're probably not used to failing.  Everyone's driven to succeed. There may not be a lot of external pressure from management to pull long hours, but folks tend to do it anyway because they want to accomplish something great. It's an easy place to feel you're below average, even when you've been tops everywhere else. Keep helping us focus on the vision of what we need to accomplish.

Cool techie environment. Learn the latest and greatest in the tech world as it develops. -Biggest problem at Google = poor managers who lack leadership skills. My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any. -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits), what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one ""owns"" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There's a lot of mediocrity, why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. -Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)  All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over! Teams need better direction. Many managers are very poor leaders who don't make decisions or set clear goals or make teammates accountable to those goals. Just letting everyone do their own thing is a problem...especially when multiple positions have to support multiple people whose own agendas create conflicts of interest (and inefficiencies and tension). You need to give stars more opportunity to grow, they need more than just new projects. You need to actually develop these people. You know that salespeople are not the only stars or potential future leaders. You need to reward and grow more than just the salespeople. Because, let's be honest, many of the salespeople are not the ones growing the revenue. They get the credit, but in the end you lose some of the people most responsible.

There used to be a three-year waiting list, but they solved that problem by raising the fees so high that most Googlers couldn't afford it. (Seriously. It was out-and-out explained that the oversubscribed daycare was an economic problem, and higher prices would resolve it.)  Come to Google for technological challenge, come for brilliant co-workers.

24898,amazon,2010,"After working as a college intern at the company I was offered a full-time position which I accepted. As a first-time job out of college I can't recommend it enough, just make sure you're on a team working on an unreleased product. An Amazon team in heads-down development mode is an amazingly productive and inventive thing. Projects are rapidly prototyped, torn down, and built anew. The build system is bar none the best I have ever used, if you need some library to do something, you just depend on it. Done.  We had a senior principal engineer acting as a sort of roaming quarterback among our teams and he frequently sat in on design brainstorming sessions. He also sat ten feet away from me, so bouncing ideas off of him was frictionless and really helped me grow as a fault-tolerant systems architect.  People wear many hats at Amazon and you can quickly make a name for yourself as ""the X guy"" if you devote yourself to being an expert in X. Plans change and you can get a golden opportunity in your lap if you're lucky. For me it was defending our system architecture against three senior principals. Get your name out there and you'll have other (potentially cooler) teams trying to headhunt you from your current one. I would recommend this strategy: stay on a project long enough to make a name for yourself in some way and then jump ship to another team. A year and a half to two years is a good periodicity for this process.  The best thing about Amazon is that if you find yourself getting tired of the same old drag in your current position, you can jump ship to another team and work on something entirely new and exciting. This is not Microsoft: there is little animosity between teams and no hard feelings will be had. You can be writing servers in Java one year, virtualization modifications to the Linux kernel the next, and messaging systems in Erlang the next.  Corporate culture is good. There aren't as many hokey ice-breaker or get-to-know-each-other events as in other companies. I once heard the company described as ""having a good drinking culture,"" which certainly was true within my team. Our outings were more like pub crawls, with pool and bowling often thrown in as an afterthought as we wandered around Capitol Hill. Good times were had.  The pay is pretty good too and I hear the stock ain't doing half bad, too.  In summary, I wholeheartedly endorse Amazon as a first out-of-college job for people who want to learn a lot about anything. Just don't dig down too much in one team and you can rise to prominence in any area you want. Within a year I was designing and implementing key pieces of our architecture and my ideas and proposals were taken as seriously as those from people with a decade or more with the company. N.B.—My team probably ranked in the top five for pager pain metrics. I've seen the histograms, and there is a long tail. You'll likely find yourself in a team with far less pager pain, but be warned that it can be bad.  Yes, you have to carry a pager. Yes, it can be hell. You will invariably try to go to a pub one hour before your rotation ends only to be paged into an event that requires a conference call with multiple VPs and on-edge datacenter engineers. You may go to bed at 1 AM Sunday night, be paged at 5 AM Monday morning and not stop firefighting until 2 AM Tuesday. It can be draining.  People say Amazon never ships a version two of anything, and I think this is the reason why. Asking your educated thought workers to sit around doing menial ""keep the stack running"" tasks can be a pain, and the small team sizes are great and all, but you'll find yourself wishing for more people to share the pager pain, misery loves company.  At one point my project entered a dark phase in which all feature development tasks were superseded by the need to just keep the service up and running. Hacks and kludges were put in place to reduce the load and extreme measures were taken to keep us up and running. In retrospect, our project was characteristically different from other web services and this sort of thing was predictable, but we didn't get ahead of the problem quickly enough. One tends to blame management when these things happen, saying ""we'll take the technical debt and put it on the backlog for now"" one too many times can result in one hell of a lot of interest to pay off.  The whole period seemed like hell when it was happening, a team member switched teams, the intern went back to college, the managers did a nice little switcharoo, we had three developers to actually code. But it passed. And I got an offer with another team with essentially no oncall rotation and whose work I really admired. I didn't take it because I knew I'd soon leave the company due to a cross-country move (I didn't want to join a brand new team for only two months), but the thought crossed my mind.  So if you have a needy family, enjoy sleeping, or can't bear the thought of a pager, maybe Amazon is not for you. If you're willing to look past that in order to work at a company that actually ships products (rather than having them always in beta or research), I say the pain outweighs the gain. Being second to market is not always the end of the world. Ship early, ship often is fine, but when crucial flaws are found putting band-aids over them and saying ""we'll take the debt"" is not a good solution. We don't have anyone nearby in the web services category and I'd rather see things ship perfect than them ship first and have terrible performance issues.  But I'm not a manger and I'm not a businessman. Perhaps the added personnel and hardware and emotional costs are eventually overcome by all the cash that comes in.",-4.2628365,-8.204411,-0.025192557401864508,0.07610506419908554,4.0,0.12682697031101287,0.48547538454453343

You can move up in the ranks if you are willing to throw people under the bus and use buzz words such as green-belt, six-sigma, standard deviation even though you don't really understand them completely. Company motivates employees with fear and pressure. Senior management pressures associates and managers to just get the job done without offering any help or guidence. This is because the system is broken and they don't have the answers either. But instead of realizing this, they will throw you under the bus any chance they get because they fear for their reputation.  Because the business model of Amazon includes very tight margins on their products, the company tries to save money everywhere, as a result, the facilities are run like sweat shops and associates are treated like slaves. In addition, equipment is very rickety and often creates safety hazards for workers.  While the pay is decent, as a manager you will end up working so much overtime that your salary will be comparable to an hourly associate's (again, part of the business plan to cut costs). The retention rate for Area Managers is ridiculous--something like 2-3 months.

24934,amazon,2010,"Lot's of bright people work here, and you will most likely be paid well. There are a lot of interesting problems to work on at a scale few companies can offer. Probably a very good, tough environment for a smart kid right out of school with no significant other or kids - or hobbies or any life outside of work. Unfortunately, even though I was paid more than what my position usually commands (a red flag right there I should have noticed), it just wasn't worth it. There are a *lot* of reasons I'd recommend not working here, but the two that stand out are the culture and the hours. You will work a lot of hours in whatever dept. you're in, almost without exception. But the real overriding factor in everything that makes it such a horrible place to work - the one that all the other issues grow from - is its culture.  Here's the long and short of it: front-line and middle managers here are really the 'bottom of the barrel' types. No self-respecting manager would try to manage any team in this environment (unless they didn't know anything about it when they were hired - ahem!), and that's because of one corporate-mandated policy that destroys any possibility of teamwork: Top Grading. Let me explain...  Top Grading sounds like a good idea when you only look at the 'top' part. What that means is the top 10% of performers on each team get the bulk (or all) of the raises for that team that year. This happens every year (depending on your dept., anywhere from Feb.-May), and is something so pervasive in the company that you really do risk your job if you try to stand up against it (pretty much Bezos's idea - so if your chain answers up to a Sr. VP that answers to him, it's gonna happen).  But why stand against it? Well, let's say you have a great team, and everyone's pulling their weight. The problem with this policy is, it also includes what some have called Bottom Grading - appropriately named, as it spells out the rest of the truth of the happily named Top Grading. The full truth is, you have to get rid of the bottom 10% of your team every year - period, end of story, no arguments. Basically, Amazon's 'high bar' with 'bar raisers' in interview loops comes down to little more than an inflexible ideology.  So just try and make a team in that kind of environment! Even just trying to be part of one is horrific, after all, you could be next. It's either you or someone else on your team - probably a couple or more. And this includes managers and directors.  I'm betting you can guess the result: a highly politicized environment, where everyone's going for the immediate win and doing their best to suck up to their boss at every moment, as once you're clued in, you realize your manager's or director's hands are tied. You walk on glass, and try not to *ever* cross them or give them a reason to put your name in the bottom 10%.  So that's it, in a nutshell - ideology 'tinkled down' from above loses to allowing managers to manage their own teams independently. Which pretty much explains why no competent managers would stay there, and why I left. And also why their attrition rate is horrible - 10% must go, combined with no healthy team dynamics whatsoever. It's just a real disaster over there. Stand up to the policy of Top Grading, plain and simple. Let upper management - and especially Jeff Bezos and HR - know that you're the one who's best for judging your team's performance, as a group or as individuals. Get rid of that, and I guarantee you the attrition of smart talent will disappear almost overnight.",2.206759,-7.610861,0.007079917061454553,0.07622640926299343,1.0,0.15334325396825396,0.48971119929453255

24992,amazon,2010,"Powerful business model on core retail business that drives seemingly unlimited growth. The basic principle that the company was built on which by driving lower prices it can fuel sales, gain leverage and reduce costs from vendors to further reduce prices fuel growth, etc. is brilliant due to its simplicity. In order to be successful this model requires long term thinking and Jeff Bezos is famous for that, which allows folks to focus on projects that may add a lot of value 5+ years down the road. This also leads to plenty opportunities for innovation, which are key in creating a sustainable business.  Another pro is the fact that the company focuses on three things that do not change no matter what the economy does: great prices, great selection, great customer experience. No matter what the state of external elements might be, focusing on these three things gives a company an edge.  Finally its obsession with customer satisfaction is a lesson to be learned. Being in that environment gives a unique perspective on how to manage a business that needs to be seen in practice to truly absorb. Unfortunately despite all the great strategy surrounding the business, the people management is absolutely terrible which I suspect will have long term negative consequences. There is little to no structure on how someone can grow which puts your fate completely in the hands of your manager or manager's manager. Obviously in any company they will always have a very strong influence in your career, but the lack of structure provides you with no safety net in case you happen to land on a terrible team.  There is little to no training when you start in the company, but you are expected to work your butt off and get results. It is not uncommon that managers will say that you should spend time with your families, but give you so much work that makes it almost impossible. Additionally there is little room for errors, even if you have had years of recognized achievements, a couple of months of bad luck and your thrown to the dogs.  I do have to clarify it is not like this in all departments. There are pockets of good people, but overall the senior leadership simply does not focus on their employees as much as they could/should. Simple things such as defining a function and what is expected in each level of the function would go a long way in helping people grow or at least understand why they are not growing. Evaluating managers creating a good working environment in addition to an effective one would also be helpful.  Probably the root cause of what I would call Amazon's inept HR management is the fact that Jeff B simply does not spend much time thinking about his employees and therefore does not put pressure on his top captains to create a hospitable working environment. If they valued the employees half as much as the customers, Amazon would be a great place to work at.",-10.847453,5.3833017,-0.04089547118749743,0.0008981433237139349,3.0,0.08944989106753815,0.5675879240585123

33963,amazon,2010,"Amazingly smart (and I mean really smart and CAPABLE) collegues here. Pace is superfast and everyone are committed to a common goal: customer experience. Razor sharp focus means lazy, useless people usually can't hide and are fast fired compared to other places. Great place to learn and pick up new work responsibilities - because there are so much growth it means if you are capable, they are more than happy to throw more work at you (but dont expect to be paid for it). I still occassionally miss the constant high quality/caliber of smart + capable + dedicated people that are everywhere at this company - it is really rare elsewhere. I compare Amazon to the Bains/BCGs/McKinseys of the hightech work enviorment. 1) Mgmt need to be better trained. Many people mgrs do not know how to lead. I highlight ""LEAD"" instead of ""manage"". Your experience as an employee here is dictated 100% by your mgr here, and if you are dealt a bad one, you're screwed as the company is too fast to notice what is going on with bad mgrs focused on only results and not developing their people. HR is in general useless and will not step in to help employees on these concerns. 2) Benefits are close to none. The company will make you feel you are a worthless piece of garbage via its self-critical culture (they take it too far), but somehow still give you a lot of stocks so your total compensation is still great. But you feel like a slave for our customers and newbies get burnt out by this. I got used to this as time went on but it requires a strong personality. 3) Intl divisions - especially Asia subs, are completely randomized and chaotic either in business direction or in mgmt capabilities as leaders - dont just focus on growth and make sure you have the right employee dev resources put in place and empower your HR people to actually do something. 1) Invest in Leadership development for your mgrs. Too many people mgrs are here up to VP level are not ready to be true people leaders. The pace you are at makes it invisible to see how these leaders are getting results - (a) are they getting results THRU making their people better"" or (b) getting results thru cycling thru their people as ""inventory turns"" and then tossing them out? There once some leaked comments once a GM told his people that his associates are just monkeys in order to get the shipments out of the door during peak holiday season. that is a good example how NOT to lead.  2) Make some serious HR changes. your HR is useless. Empower them to step in and stop bad behavior when appropriate. HR should be a neutral, empowered group but I found my HR partners to be powerless and scared to step in even when thing are going wrong - e.g. some intl office we were in - employees were asked to keep working while renovations were going on. dusts/building material were floating in the air daily and some of my folks were getting nose bleeds.. Advice from HR? Pls don't make a big deal out of it.. ""have you heard of asbestos?"" sooner or later some class action suit will hit if these practices don't change. HR right now are just puppets.  3) Frugality culture is fine, but dont come acrss as cheap to the bone. Toss a bone here or there to your employees and they'll be much more upbeat in morale and work even harder for you. This is a company built on Type A personality - and Type As need recognization to keep their endless fires burning.. recognize small things will make a huge difference.",-0.53891647,-6.6452355,-0.016225416654354802,0.06429444642676235,4.0,0.08265337527056282,0.5535823074494949

36402,netflix,2010,"Like many of the reviews have already said, Netflix does offer some nice employee benefits, especially the employee stock purchase program (take a look at what Netflix stock has been doing, the last couple of years - you'll wish you'd bought in 2007)  I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors.  For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly. When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.  Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome. Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros. I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.  Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable. I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold. The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.  For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT. Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?"" A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play! Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!). Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy. This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses.  Netflix does not give raises. Period. Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance. I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time. So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly. I have *never* gotten a raise. Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.  No paid time off. (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)  Mandatory overtime during the holidays. (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter. And the winter before.)  Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.  Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position. If that position goes away, so does the person. There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.  TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far. TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues. They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue. Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days."" What happened to ""one call resolution""? There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT. Thanks a lot.  Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed, we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts. This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.  Speaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations. The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website. Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out? I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"". Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"". There has to be a better way.  The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion. Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases. The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers. Thanks for another ""no"" response on my DSAT, Marketing department! The service works so well. Figure out a way to make your human resources department work at least half as well. You are losing good employees at a ridiculous rate, which is going to start affecting customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line. Dealing with the general public is stressful enough, your outstanding employees shouldn't have to deal with unfair treatment from you, as well.",-5.1387553,-13.075705,-0.03958886001852443,0.07575929251824606,2.0,0.12479551467051471,0.5102703222703223

Period. -cliquish environment (if you're not with the in crowd, you're invisible.) -very poor communication about job performance -do not uphold their own company values -rarely promote from within -contradictions galore!  In the nine days I was there for training before being unfairly dismissed, I saw several examples of employees being treated like children and unreasonably scolded. One girl was in the classroom 5 minutes before break was over. She suddenly had a bathroom emergency, so she left quickly to take care of it. She made it back just as they were shutting the door. On the next break, she was taken aside by the supervisor (supe) who said, ""I noticed you made it back from break just as I was shutting the door. I just wanted to let you know that's unacceptable. You need to be back from break several minutes early."" (In other words, you really don't get your full break.) She apologized, saying she'd been there five minutes early but had an emergency. He said, ""I'm sure it won't happen again.""  One girl had to call in sick because her child gave her the flu. They forced her to speak to three different people who scolded her, the last of which was the call center manager himself! He said he was going to give her the opportunity to come in for the rest of the week.  Another girl simply asked her neighbor for a pen during class. She was pulled into a conference room afterward and told by two different supes that talking during class was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated.  Netflix has a zero-tolerance policy for what they call ""push back"". They touched on this very briefly in class during our second week of training. The example they gave was this: ""If your supe tells you to change something and you say, 'I don't feel like it, so I'm not going to', that's considered push back and will not be tolerated."" Basically, it's outright insubordination. My supe said I needed to work on verifying every account. When people call in, their account auto-pops onscreen....unless they don't give their service code to the automated answering service before they're transferred to a live person. This happens about half the time and it's mostly people who don't have accounts and are just asking about the service. So I asked my supe, ""Is that even when they're just calling with a general question about the website?"" He said we needed to at least ask for a name and warned me that what I'd just said was considered push back but he'd let it slide this time. I was baffled but just said, ""Okay."" The same supe told me he liked that I was resolution oriented because that was a good thing. An hour later, he took it back saying it was bad and I needed to focus on empathy. When I was let go, they gave me the opportunity to give feedback. I mentioned the contradictions I'd noticed and also that I didn't understand how asking a simple question during training was considered ""push back"". I was told that it's all about perception and I just wasn't a right fit. They also said this sort of thing happens often.  Before you go to work for Netflix, ask yourself this: if the pay is excellent and the benefits are great, why is the turnover rate at Netflix so high??? Why are there so many bad employee reviews out there? Notice the recurring themes in the reviews, i.e. lack of respect, no job security, fear based business, no career growth opportunity, etc. There comes a time when the realization that it's not everybody else, it's the company, has to set in.

36424,netflix,2010,"The pay is above market. Not a lot above market, but a bit above market. The drawback is there are absolutely no benefits to speak of (no health benefits, no training, no daycare) so that above market pay gets eaten up pretty fast by real world needs. A total fear of failure permeates the ranks. Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake, and then fires you after your second mistake. This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20%. Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years, nobody knows what process to follow, and everything is chaotic. HR solves this by saying ""there is no process for anything! Make it up as you go along!"" Sure, if I fired all the employees every few years I'd stay away from process too.  The key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover. The ass covering at Netflix is legendary. Nobody wants to innovate. Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone. Netflix has created a culture of fear, and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear (they immediately demonize the terminated employee, and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others).  The culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs, and that is to threaten to fire them. There simply is no other process for managing poor performance (remember, there is no process - they will admit this to you if you ask).  And finally, the last thing you should be warned about is their ""high performance"" culture. Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees weren't high performers. But since there is no process, no record-keeping, there is no objective measurement of performance. So ""high performers"" end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile. ""High performers"" at Netflix are not employees that take risks, interact with outside groups, or produce a high volume of work.  Netflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that I've ever seen. They are completely happy to manage with fear, however. If you put those two insane concepts together you end up with a rather hysterical environment. So you guys did one thing well, a long time ago, and you've been marginally improving that business (DVD rental) ever since. Your astoundingly high turnover rate worked in that world, because all the processes were in place. But now you are trying to get into the streaming business, and that business only runs with knowledge workers at the helm. And guess what? Knowledge workers are pretty well-connected. The word is out that Netflix does not value its employees and as a result it's going to be harder and harder to staff your new ventures. You really need to find the groups at Netflix with the highest turnover and keep those managers away from the streaming business. You have some managers that simply do not know how to manage, they only know how to fire and hire.

There are conflicting values and many managers don't practice what Netflix preaches. If you associate with the right people, this can help your career, but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures. Yes, it's great we all get Blackberries or iPhones (and are reachable 24/7) and have a liberal vacation policy, but the aura of paranoia that invades the office due to the frequent restructurings is not conducive to successful business practices.

You have to deliver the bad news. You have to be able to deal with pissed of customers, work quickly, be creative and sharp. It's a huge step up from the specialist position, and although it requires only a tenth of the technical skill required to be Genius, it requires just as strong an ability to work with angry, upset and confused customers with broken tech.

Everybody believes in the product to a good extent and engineers ability to provide input on many aspects of a product even if it's not their area of expertise (such as user interface, process, and general quality).  There is little bureaucracy and politics for a company of its size. I've worked for companies many times smaller with far more politics which creates inefficiencies through needless intracompany competitiveness and lack of communication. This is less so at Apple due to 3 reasons: 1) Almost everybody is in Cupertino so it's a lot less likely you'll talk behind someone's back if you actually see them face to face in meetings. 2) There is a culture of communication where it's okay to provide input on process without people getting very offended (Apple's own bug tracking system is part of this. 3) Steve Jobs is on top of things, if he see's bureaucracy he will cut it out, and even if he doesn't there is a fear that if he does see you as a bureaucrat he will cut you out.  I like the people a lot here: They are very smart and pretty humble. There is not much individual arrogance which makes it a comfortable place to be (although there is a fair amount of arrogance on the products). Good focus on products. The focus on products (and profits) means it's unlikely for Apple to stray into new territory or experiment with something that doesn't have a clear path for profitability. (There will never by a policy at Apple which allows engineers to spend %20 of their time working on some experimental project like Google or other companies have).  There is some arrogance on the products where engineers believe what they have done is THE right way to do it despite users having valid complaints about it.  Apple is pretty cheap. It's difficult to get managers to to spend money or invest unless there is a clear path for profitability as the result of the investment (this includes training such as books and conferences). Thats one of the reasons it's go $46 billion in the bank.  Also as a result of the company's frugality, Apple hasn't really shared it's success with employees who have worked very hard to get it there. There is job stability in a poor economy, but there is no profit sharing or increase in bonuses as a result of record revenues and profitability. Not even the products are given to employees or discounted very highly.

Additionally, there is a fairly wide variety of things Apple does, more so than the typical valley company (everything from engineering to retail), so you (might) get exposed to some interesting facets of the business.  The people are, generally, nice, smart people. Apple employees can often be a bit more passionate and/or opinionated than some at other places I've worked at, but I generally consider this a good thing.  The general benefits are ok - not great, and I've gotten better elsewhere, but I've also certainly gotten worse. The employee discount is ok. If you're into trendy pop music, you might spot a music star on campus or playing at a beer bash every now and then. For a big corporate entity, the general secrecy policy really can work against the efficiency of the company. Apple still manages to make it work, but from what I've seen, things could be so much smoother if people were allowed to be more open with information. Mind you, I'm talking about within the company itself - yes, I've been in plenty of situations where employees in different depts are not allowed to talk directly to each other due to this policy.  Apple tends to be very frugal, for a company with billions in the bank. Salary and equity aside, they don't seem to really hire everywhere that's needed - only on those projects that really have the attention of upper management. Other projects and products, while still producing, suffer from limited resources, and creativity and production is stifled.  There's the usual management hierarchy problems present at any large corporation. At Apple, there tend to be middle managers who have been with Apple a long time, are happy with there lot, and have decided to impede progress for anyone below them.

For example, when something is released and it is slightly wrong or people are unhappy with it the everyone in the company needs to be prepared to take one stance on the subject and hold onto that stance until Apple says other wise. Communication over RNN is great but, sometimes I feel as if I would like to be able to check my Apple webmail from home, even if I'm part-time.

Some groups may be different but in many you are graded on how many bugs you fix how quickly, not how many you examine, or resolve in other ways but how many code is changed for. No matter what your expertise eveyone has to prove themselves in the same trenches. This is disaster if you are older but very experienced. Few 50+ or even 40+ software engineers can sling code as fast as their 20 or 30 year peers or self. There is little acknowledgment of different skills and needs. If you are at a more senior level you are also expected to do this while impressing Apple with you creativity and grasp of cross functional areas and cross-functional interaction. Never mind creativity takes time and experiments and management support you haven't earned in the salt mine yet.  As a software environment I found Apple very chaotic and poorly organized. Each release, every part of the software practically may change at once and throughout the entire period. Little or no layering or getting the base layers solid for the next level of development. Constant eating of dogfood. Sometimes you can't get your own work down for long stretches because of bad internal builds. Oh yeah, you are often expected to install and attempt to work on several new builds a month. There is little or no internal documentation or formal software design whatsoever. Just a lot of bright programmers flaying away for the most part. Sad, so much brain power wasted. The secrecy is so bad you are not allowed to know things that have direct bearing on your own area and even on your success. The only documentation of much of the software is in the bug tracking system and in mail and all ad hoc. As you struggle to fix your quota of bugs you learn to find the minimal patch that works without blowing things up. This leaves the software a shoddy non-cohesive patchwork over time.  Apple is arrogant as hell or rather some of its VPs and Jobs himself dictate how many things should be done that many of its senior engineers know is the wrong way to proceed. Apple has a serious phobia about using good database technology and shipping same. Core Data is good as far as it goes but that isn't all that far as far as db capabilities. It is oriented to one app only. In general Apple has a very App centric view. And senior management loves files. Lots and lots of little files - even one per record. It is the model they based Spotlight and to a decree, Time Machine on. The industry knows this is not the way to go but it seems Apple has to periodically reinvent the wheel badly and call it great. Practice much better software engineering with actual design documentation. Give teams room to rewrite and re-architect Apple shipped software so it doesn't become stale or become a patchwork.  Do not treat every engineer the same. Listen to your senior people and give them a lot of room to be creative and find a way to improve Apple from day one. Don't burn them out in the bug trenches. Make it much more obvious that you actually give a damn about eliciting each engineer's best and those things they can bring to Apple.  Ship a real database and integrate data across applications.  Never ever leave 3rd party devs high and dry. Extend functionality to richer better functionality - don't just take things away or tell them they have to redo things differently periodically unless there is real payoff for them.  Stop insisting that Objective C / Cocoa is the one and only truly blessed way. Since Apple controls that utterly you condemn 3rd party devs and your own employees to Apple only lock in. Not nice. Objective C was great in the 80s and slowly Apple has added things to make it almost sort of modern. But it is not state of the art no matter how much Steve crows about how wonderful it is.

I met lots of great people: fellow employees, celebrities, academics, artists, musicians, models, etc. The benefits were stellar: 401k, full medical/dental/vision, two weeks paid, discounted stock purchase program, discounts on merchandise. As a Mac Genius, you are fairly replaceable. When I started at Apple, being a Mac Genius was really special. But by the time I left, after the company had expanded rapidly and opened dozens of new stores, the talent level and expectations had dropped considerably. Therefore, it was not uncommon to get fired for minor offenses and starting salary had declined precipitously for MG's by the time I left (as much as $10/hr less).  Higher retail managers were often drafted from places like Gap/AF/B&N, etc so they had little technical skill and product knowledge. This diminished the culture somewhat for die-hard Mac heads like me and other MG's and salespeople. Management was overly self-congratulatory about their sales figures: anyone can look like a brilliant sales manager when the product is iPhones, Macbooks, and iPods--this stuff sells itself. Don't forget that, ladies and gents.  As a Mac Genius, there is little opportunity to move up. ""Lead Mac Genius"" is a supervisory position that very few attain and it carries little if any bump in pay. Like many companies, Apple has a bad habit of hiring management from outside the company (for some reason, someone from someplace else always seems more talented than the good soldiers you have in your own back yard). I still know extremely talented leaders who are MG's who have been passed over time and again for management positions. Provide easier access to pro-apps training.

The mantra is ""this is retail"" which is at least a shot at honesty. Training time for creatives is not a priority even though pro certifications are high on the priority list. So I guess I expected to get the opportunity to learn more in-depth stuff about Apple pro software and then teach it to customers who are using those products. Instead creatives at our store are used as fill ins anywhere else in the store when we are not training.

Recognize your employees are on your side and that building honest relationships is long-term more profitable than selling mobileme to customers who don't need it.

49368,apple,2010,"Many of your co-workers will be intelligent, funny people who are a real pleasure to work with and to get to know. You'll be able to tell everyone you know that you work for Apple, which carries a certain respect with it. Your healthcare benefits package will be excellent. You'll never have to use a PC at work. First of all, despite what you're told at hiring events and new employee training, you don't really work for Apple, Inc. Instead, you work for Apple Retail, which is for all intents and purposes an entirely different company. There is little to no career connection between the two, and retail employees are looked upon as second class citizens by corporate employees. Your chances of getting promoted from Apple Retail to Apple Corporate are no better than they would be if you worked for anywhere else. In fact, they might be worse.  The day to day routine of working for Apple Retail has some significant problems. You can expect that your needs will always come second to ""the needs of the business."" In fact, anytime you hear that phrase, be prepared for the next sentence to describe how you're going to be screwed. For example, ""I'm sorry, Joe, but the needs of the business dictate that you can't take a vacation between October and February, or June through September"" or ""Well, the needs of the business mean we can't give you a fixed schedule."" Your schedule will be erratic. You may work from 2 PM to 12 AM on Tuesday and be expected to come in at 8 AM the following day. If there's a product being launched (iPhone, iPad, etc), you may be asked to work overnight to set up the store, then come back in the next day and work another shift. Sometimes you're asked to work straight through. During normal weeks your shifts will often be right in the middle of the day, leaving you little time to accomplish anything before or after. No scheduling preference is given based on seniority, family considerations, or any other factor. Any and all time off must be requested in writing, often several months in advance, but your schedule won't arrive until a few days before it goes into effect. Long stretches of the year are blacked out for vacation time, due to the needs of the business. Favored employees will often be given a pass to take vacations during this time, especially senior managers.  Your coworkers will be neatly divided into two groups: those who are able to rationalize any decision made by Apple Inc, and those who understand the company for what it really is. There will be many more of the former than the latter. If you're a member of the relentlessly optimistic tribe, you can probably do very well in Apple Retail. If you're not, be prepared to hear impromptu speeches about how Apple products ""change"" and ""enrich"" people's lives, and how amazing it is to work at Apple. Many of these people will be older, and some will have either failed at or quit other careers to sell computers for a few dollars above minimum wage, which adds an undertone of desperation to their happy message. If you find yourself in the less optimistic camp, be prepared to be part of a very small minority, and get ready to hear about it when you decide to speak your mind. In fact, don't speak your mind.  Overall, Apple Retail is a place that spends a lot of time and money to promote the idea that they Really Care about their employees. One of the first things you're given when you're hired is the Credo Card, which lays out all that Apple Retail stands for and believes in. The very first line of the card is, ""At Apple our heart and soul is our people."" But what you'll come to realize over time is that Apple Retail doesn't care about you at all. They care about making money, and above all pleasing the customers. And that's it.  If you hope to have a long, successful and rewarding career at Apple Retail, you'd better really love retail for it's own sake. Loving the products isn't enough, in time you'll grow to resent them. You need to love all the complicated, illogical, arcane intricacies that make up the American retail model. If you do, you'll probably do very well at Apple. If not, it won't be long before you'll be looking for a way out. Be honest with the people you're hiring. Learning to set the right expectation is a huge part of a retail employee's training, so why should it be any different for employees? Also, try to integrate Retail and Corporate better, so the bright people you have working in Retail will have a place to go. Even though it might hurt your wallets a little, try to think of your employees first once in a while. A little of that will go a long way.",1.1682705,-14.407929,-0.014659806502009758,0.07089546607416397,2.0,0.15127416188462695,0.4492818131480921

60534,microsoft,2010,"1) Corporate commitment to workplace diversity (race, sex, religion, culture, etc.) 2) A ""name"" company 3) Not likely to go out of business soon 4) Plenty of learning opportunities 5) If you find the right job and the right manager, it's a great experience 6) Usually good flexibility for working parents 7) Smart and diversified co-workers Here's what I've learned after several years:  1) There's no appreciation of your previous career experience--if you haven't done it at MS, it doesn't count. This ""Not Invented Here"" attitude impedes creative thinking. 2) The performance rating system is seriously flawed--a substantial (25%) amount of your time is spent doing low-value tasks indirectly related to your job. These tasks are injected into your performance plan so your manager has a way to measure you and compare you to others. 3) **YOUR YEARLY PERFORMANCE RATING IS DETERMINED FIRST AND THEN YOU'RE INFORMED--there's no way to change a bad/erroneous review**. 4) The employee calibration system forces your manager to put 10% of her team in the ""below standard"" level, meaning you're not going to be promoted for at least a year OR you're going to be ""managed out"" (fired) even if you've achieved the goals you and your manager set down in writing at the beginning of the year. This ""stack-ranking"" system into 20%-70%-10% brackets determines your the ""contribution margin"" and is based on managers' discussions, hearsay, and perceived age (discrimination). It affects how much stock--a form of deferred compensation--you get that year. Again, you have no way of changing your standing--it's all decided behind tightly-closed doors. 5) It's fairly hard to change jobs--you can't interview without your manager's permission unless you've been in role 18 months. Many postings are dummy postings because a candidate's already been selected and the hiring manager has to go through the process. And most of the jobs are so specific that it's hard to jump across organizations unless you can get an insider to recommend you. 6) Cost-cutting has had a negative impact on every aspect of the Company, and it's nearly impossible to get business travel approval unless you're in sales or consulting. 7) For a technology company, there's far too much management overhead and this leads to slow decision-making. Very few people here are willing to stand up and to make a decision or to go out on a limb to support their position. 8) Microsoft is an extremely matrixed organization and that reality often impedes your ability to get things done rapidly. 9) There are few ""people managers"" at Microsoft. At levels below General Manager, ""managers"" have a **regular workload** in addition to their people management responsibilities, and this is when people management is most important and valued. At the GM level and above, it's about headcount, not individuals. 10) In the U.S., the HR department offers very little career development support and no individual assistance. You're supposed to work through your manager, who may or may not know anything. 11) Promotions are handed out based on excellence in your current role, budget, and business need. So, even if you've been the top performer on your team and have done everything just right, you may be stuck. Thnis is why many people leave Microsoft. 12) It's very unusual to get a promotion when you get a new job--that's why they're called ""internal transfers"". 1) Redesign the employee evaluation system to reflect today's Microsoft. 2) Encourage management boldness. 3) I recognize the need to address health care costs but let's stop the nickle-and-diming. 4) I love Steve Ballmer and believe he's committed to the Company but the stock has been flat for a decade--it's time to bring Bill G back into the fold.",-14.709183,-1.1337386,-0.06918557021846436,0.028127070824165223,2.0,0.08381705100455099,0.45866071962225796

Microsoft has changed over the past several years and unfortunately not all of it is positive. My observations: - If you get a first job there, you'll probably come in at a very low level and you'll be stuck there for a while. Promotions are getting less frequent every year. If you've guts, you are better off quitting the company, become a vendor or do something else, and be re-hired as an external candidate. You'll accelerate your career as you reset your history - Microsoft is an aggregation of different silos that don't talk to each other. Exec egos and turf battles come at the expense of the 'greater good' - The company is plagued with processes that makes it slow to react to more agile internet players. If you're an entrepreneur at heart, you'll suffer (a lot) at Microsoft, unless you're there for the 'enterprise experience' and you leave after a few years. Beware though. Because the company is so big, there are always pockets of excellence where things can happen fast. Those are usually the products version 1, where excitement and speed mean survival before the next executive review - A large chunk of middle management is not hungry anymore. If they have been there for many years, they don't want to compromise their comfort. They care more about their 'green scorecard' than taking risks for the sake of moving Microsoft forward. - Many employees feel so passionate about their products that they live in denial that there is a world out there. By closing their eyes to the reality, they don't learn about what the competition does and what customers need. It's easier to drink the company koolaid than make an effort to be self critical  Again, don't judge Microsoft just by looking at one group. The silos are very different from each other and you may find happiness in another group. Accelerate the time from R&D to market. It's amazing how many ideas get conceived internally that never see the light our there. Don't overlook the 'coolness factor'.

Despite the cons I list below, if you can be confident in what you do, have regular, honest conversations with your boss about your career, you can learn to ignore the silliness, and just have fun getting your job done. And get fairly well paid to do it. The compensation system at higher levels is designed to get people to not play nice together. At lower levels, the difference in compensation between a great review and a mediocre one really isn't that much - you can work collaboratively, learn from your coworkers, mentor newer coworkers, etc.  The differentiation in compensation at higher levels is extreme, and leads to ... shall we say ... sociopathic behavior being rewarded exorbitantly. It's possible to do well, while still being a good person who respects the opinions and work of your coworkers. It's easier to do well if you can pretend to do that, while making sure you get the credit for good things, and none of the blame for bad things.  *****  MS only really gets serious when a market is threatened, and then it takes time to spin up the machine. Once the train is rolling, we're pretty unstoppable, but it can seem to take a *lot* of effort and public embarrassment to get the train rolling. I still recall the day some VP announced that MS's opinion was that development of the browser was essentially done - there was nothing new left to do. So, the IE team was being disbanded. And now, 6 years later, we're trying to catch up. Same with phone - ""the iphone will never amount to anything"". I've seen internal talking points passed around about how the iphone wasn't as good because it didn't have a *tasks* app - that's the kind of internal propaganda you'll have to deal with. SteveB is undoubtedly a really smart guy, and cares more about MS than anyone else there. But he just doesn't seem to ""get"" technology. His focus is on the business plan. Always. (I suspect he would consider this a compliment.)  But, sometimes you do stuff, just because it's cool, and it wins you credit with the right crowd - Google gets this - many things they do make no money directly, but build up Google's excellent name with influential people. This is what turns engineers on. We like making money, and we like the share of it that gets passed to us (we have cars to buy and student loans to pay down, and kids to send to school, after all). But, we are happiest working on something for its own sake. We certainly need someone figuring out how much of that we have the money to do, and trying to figure out how to monetize the cool stuff. But, I'm not entirely convinced that person has to be the CEO.  If we show love to our users, they will love us back. No matter how many times we insist that our brand is the most valuable, thus users love is, it's easy to point to things we do, that prove we don't really care about the users, once we have their money.

There comes a time when you pass 40 years old that you reach your personal maximum level. The company career process is not equipped to deal with that.

They often have almost no say in what should be done or how best to do it. (This, like many of the other cons, depends on the specific product group, but it is very common and prevalent enough to be of concern to anyone looking to work for Microsoft). - Certain managers make 100% of the decisions around the whats, whens, and hows of employee work without being open to any feedback from the employee. - Teamwork takes a backseat to individual success.

It is fun to meet them and work with them. The Kellogg alumni at MS are especially helpful and nice.  2. Networking/Company Culture The company encourages a lot of networking and exchange of information. It allows you to meet people from other groups and learn about their projects. It is nice to know that the work you're doing does not stay in a vacuum and that you are able to leverage other people's knowledge and best practices, so that you're not spinning your wheels.  3. Opportunities It is encouraged to rotate and spend 16 - 18 months with different groups and doing different things, so it gives everyone a great opportunity to network within the company and try different things. 1. Team Culture My team had an intense culture, due to all being ex-consultants and due to working on the strategy of the flagship product. It was a different culture than I expected and was therefore disappointed. However, I did enjoy working and collaborating with them. It was more of a personality and style issue. So my advice would be to interview the team as they are interviewing you during the second round.  2. Size of the Company The company felt really big and it felt like it could swallow someone who was not doing the ""right"" things (e.g. networking constantly, changing jobs every 18 months, working intensely on side projects, etc.). I felt like it added an extra step on the responsibilities that came with the job.  3. Seattle Seattle was a fun city to be over the summer.

Make sure you understand the dynamics and culture of the team you're thinking of working with. It can either be a horrible experience of an awesome one. Good news is if you're not happy, there's plenty of other divisions and groups to work for. Another con is Microsoft is famous for its BGHS (Big Giant Head Syndrome). Meetings are always rat-hole'd by smarty pants that feel it's important to argue and debate details to the point that you'll be lucky to get through 2-3 slides of your presentation. Some people are difficult to work with because they are very extroverted and opinionated. Having strong communication skills is paramount to surviving here.

60834,microsoft,2010,"This perspective is from the Online Services Division, specifically the ad platform teams.  Similar to many other reviews, it is nice that we have beautiful offices, pretty decent compensation (more on this later), and super smart people.  Unlike many other divisions, Microsoft is not the dominant force in this particular industry. So the varied stereotypes of a ""monopolistic Microsoft"" or ""large company intent on a closed software system"" here, do not necessarily hold true. You can see that in conversations with customers. They want us to do well. They want us to be a strong, viable competitor to the other big players in the online advertising industry. This is a huge plus when it comes to the willingness of customers to work with us, especially given our big name. It also manifests in a strong focus and collaboration among the dedicated engineering, business group and sales teams. It's a pro in the sense that the advertising business needs to be an open ecosystem and that is refreshing if you've never worked here before.  One other pro that I'll mention is the fact that there is incredible talent in the strategy teams. There's a ton of great strategic work going on here that you can get behind and use as your north star. Knowing that executives are working hard to make sure we're well-positioned in the industry makes the work all the more worthwhile. That determination is clear throughout the organization. But it's not all rosy. There are certainly a lot of things to be aware of, if you have never worked at Microsoft.  When I joined, I was surprised by a few things about the organization:  1) It's true that promotions are hard to come by. You could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons. This is incredibly frustrating and had I known this earlier, I would have done more then rather than to learn it after several years. But I believe it takes a certain type of person. You need to know how to manage upwards extremely well. Talk to your manager. Be firm about what you want and when. Be incredibly focused on what moves the needle. And have great impact and influence on others. It's easy to be distracted on other things.  2) It takes a long time to get things done. Because it's such a large organization, great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy, priorities, and action items. There are so many people to get buy-in from. But if you build the relationships and understand how the system works, you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects. If you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out, etc, then I would caution you to think hard about this. Get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete.  3) There are a lot of managers here who don't do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities. It's definitely hard because a manager wants their team to perform well but they also want to contribute directly to the organization's success. Balancing this effectively is hard and few do it very well. I hope that management will learn to cultivate better managers and empower managers to find creative ways to recognize employees more frequently. Also, due to the various divisions at Microsoft, collaboration ACROSS divisions can be very hard, despite the consequences on our business that exist if collaboration doesn't occur.",-1.1705548,4.5337,-0.0065315358849391564,0.0034749869231283873,3.0,0.18224914965986394,0.5285879629629628

The current MSFT stock price hovers around $25.00-$31.00 and has been that way for the past ten years because unlike Apple, Microsoft lacks the ""Wow"" factor. Xbox is nice but that was chasing the competition as is everything else Microsoft does today. Microsoft is unfortunately a follower and not an innovator. They would usually wait until a competitor is doing something before taking action. Great examples are Firefox - if FF didn't come along, everybody would still be using IE6. If Googles online services didn't come along, Windows Live probably would not have happened. No Playstation, No Xbox etc etc. Hire leaders that can lead people instead of managers with zero leadership skills but were chosen to be leaders because they have good technical skills. Leaders lead people and they manage resources. The new review process is no better than the last one. Employees who are part of the inner circle get the best reviews every year. Employees who do most of the work but are not part of the inner circle get managed out. Nepotism is running rampant at Microsoft. This is because they hire people from all over the world who also bring their cultures with them which is a good thing as we can all learn a lot, but when it gets to the point where the majority of organizational leadership is made up entirely of a group of people from one country then they hire like minds which are all people from their own country and then have a tendency to conduct business the way business is conducted in their home country which does not work here and creates high amounts of tension and animosity because the employees not from there are treated different. Everyone knows this is going on, but nobody wants to talk about it.

60865,microsoft,2010,"The benefits at Microsoft can't be beat. I haven't paid for health-related costs in the ten years I've been there. The company is also incredibly diverse, giving you lots of options for moving around to different disciplines and products. And the resources you have available to you are pretty unbeatable (funding, etc). Microsoft suffers from a few systemic problems that make it an increasingly miserable place to work.  First, people management is an under-appreciated discipline at Microsoft. Instead of promoting employees who are truly interested in and have a talent for management, the company simply promotes the smartest, most accomplished individual contributors into leadership positions. This creates an environment where managers spend much of their time continuing to work as individual contributors (where there natural talents lie), and neglect the critical tasks of managing and leading their teams.  Second, Microsoft has always prided itself on hiring the ""best and the brightest."" This, unfortunately, has been taken to an extreme. The company has a weakness for people who are undoubtedly smart, but often socially inept and acutely uncollaborative. Having worked in both engineering and marketing organizations, it's a problem that spans multiple disciplines at the company. This can make it a very frustrating place to work. Meetings get mired in arguments over esoteric details instead of focusing on the ""big picture"", decisions get postponed or constantly revisited because someone is always uncovering new information that needs to be analyzed to the nth degree, and innovation grinds to a crawl amid people more interested in proving that they're smarter than the guy next to them, instead of working together toward a common goal. As these ""best and brightest"" inevitably get promoted, these problems are only exacerbated at more senior levels of the company.  Finally, the company is hypocritical in its approach to managing attrition. On one hand, Microsoft is ruthless in how it manages ""middle of the road"" performers. People who are good at what they do and enjoy their work, but who aren't interested in climbing the corporate ladder, are often ranked in the ""bottom 10%"" of the company during annual review. This sends the wrong message to solid performers, and severely hurts their chances of finding other positions within the company. On the other hand, human resources policies and corporate fears of litigation make it nearly impossible to fire people who truly are under-performers. Having worked in the public and private sectors, I found it substantially easier to fire people from government positions than from Microsoft.
